" Activist Teesta Setalvad was today questioned by city crime branch officials here today in connection with the alleged Gulberg Society fund misuse case. Setalvad, who appeared before the officials around 11 am, was quizzed for about seven hours, crime branch sources said. Talking to reporters after the questioning, Setalvad claimed that she is innocent and had been framed in a false case. \As directed by the Gujarat High Court, I have given my statement to the officials. Other accused in the case will give their statement tomorrow. I am booked in a false case. I have done nothing wrong and I have all the documents to support my claims,\"" she said. Earlier on December 5, the Gujarat High Court had directed Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri's son Tanvir along with former Gulberg society resident Firoz Gulzar to appear before the crime branch every fortnight in this case. The High Court gave this direction while hearing anticipatory bail applications filed by Setalvad and three others, in which they have contended that the city crime branch of the Gujarat police was interested in arresting her and others in the fund misuse case. Setalvad and others sought anticipatory bail from the High Court as the city sessions court here had rejected their pre-arrest bail plea on March 25. The city crime branch, in January this year, had registered an FIR against Setalvad and others for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore collected by them in the form of donations for turning Gulberg Society into a riots museum. The issue had surfaced when twelve residents of Gulberg society had demanded Rs 1.51 crore from Setalvad last year alleging that the money collected in their name for making museum at the Gulberg society was usurped by her and never distributed to them even after they dropped the idea of the museum. On February 28, 2002, following the Godhra Sabarmati train carnage, 69 people including former MP Ehsan Zafri were killed by an unruly mob at the Gulberg Society here during the riots. """
"FILE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Press Trust of India photo) New Delhi:Β  A US court has ordered Prime Minister Narendra Modi to answer allegations that he failed to stop the communal riots in Gujarat in 2002, as he arrives for his first trip to the United States in over a decade. The petitioner in the case is the American Justice Center, a non-profit human rights organisation, acting on behalf of two survivors of the 2002 riots in Gujarat. Mr Modi was serving his first term as Chief Minister of his home state when the riots erupted. More than 1,000 people were killed, most of them Muslims. The US court has given Mr Modi 21 days to respond. The civil case before a New York court seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Mr Modi for \crimes against humanity\"" and extrajudicial killings under the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act. \""There is evidence to support the conclusion that minister Modi committed both acts of intentional and malicious direction to authorities in India to kill and maim innocent persons of the Muslim faith,\"" the petition said. After years of being unwelcome in the United States, Mr Modi arrives for a five-day visit on Friday in New York, where he will speak at the United Nations before heading to Washington for talks with President Barack Obama. The first meeting between the two leaders follows Mr Modi's landslide general election victory in May. Mr Modi, 64, was denied a US visa in 2005 under the terms of a 1998 US law that bars entry to foreigners who have committed \""particularly severe violations of religious freedom\"". Critics accuse Mr Modi, who was chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 until this year, of doing too little to stop the riots. He has always denied any wrongdoing and was exonerated in a Supreme Court inquiry in 2012. A government spokesman was not available for comment while a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party declined to comment. An analyst said the case was unlikely to have much impact. \""The evidence against him is based on conjecture as the courts in India have found. This case won't make much difference,\"" said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Mr Modi will draw perhaps the largest crowd ever by a foreign leader on US soil when he takes the stage on Sunday at New York's Madison Square Garden before a crowd forecast to total more than 18,000 people. Mr Modi is not the first leader to be sued in a US court. A rights group called Sikhs for Justice had filed a case against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, alleging that she played a role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. That case was also filed in Federal Court of Southern District of New York. The group also filed a similar case against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

"Teesta Setalvad, whose house and offices were searched by the Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday, said that she was 'outraged' and called it a 'political game'. The CBI had registered a case on July 8 against Setalvad's Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) for allegedly receiving around $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The CBI alleged that Setalvad's firm was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore ($2.9 lakh) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from Union Home Ministry, official sources said. Setalvad told Mirror that search begain around 8 am. \I said we are willing to cooperate. I have been tortured by the Gujarat police since 2004 and I asked them that I wanted my lawyers to be there for the sake of prosecution. \""Two of our advocates arrived and then the search started. They have taken the original copies of documents we had already given to the ministry of home affairs in April and June. They also took some account related files. There is not a single document which has any incriminating details. This is completely a political game and is being managed by the PMO under which the CBI operates. \""This is outrageous, we offered full cooperation when MHA contacted us and gave them a detailed index on June 30 and were ready to appear before them. I am so upset and outraged, there is no reason to behave like this. The state of the country is so bad... in Vyapam case people are dying, in Asaram Bapu case witnesses are dying and human rights defenders are being hounded by the CBI. \""Sabrang Communications is a private limited company. We got our Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in 2007 and we have a separate account under the Act. Sabrang Communications has consultancies with two or three organisations and that is allowed under the FCRA. I completely rebut the CBI claim,\"" she said. CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad, however, said the searches were being conducted after following the due process of law and also countered the cooperation claim of Setalvad, contending \""as far as cooperation with CBI is concerned, they have not been able to explain the violation of the FCRA\"". Stating that there was no need for a raid, Setalvad said the CBI could have just given them an inspection memo. Armed with court warrants, the CBI sleuths searched four places including premises owned by Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and the office of SCPPL. The CBI, which is probing the firm's accounts from 2004 to 2014, claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money had been received from a US-based NGO, Ford Foundation, and that it was not cleared by the Home Ministry, they said. Alleging political vendetta, Setalvad said: \""This is completely spurious and nothing short of a political campaign where they want to malign us. They want to prevent legal aid in the Zakiya Jafri case, Naroda Patiya appeal, the Sardarpura appeal and all the Gujarat 2002 related cases that have reached a crucial point in the Gujarat High Court. On July 27, arguments in the Zakiya Jafri appeal will begin and it is very important for the country. Zakiya Jafri is going to argue against the rejection of protest petition and will ask for a charge sheet to be registered against Narendra Modi and 59 others.\"" A team of around 20 CBI officers conducted searches at Teesta's house and office on Juhu Tara Road in Santacruz and at Gulam Mohammed Peshimam's place in Bandra (West), the CBI said. \""Today's searches at three places in Mumbai and the seizure of documents from there has led the investigators to come across the material that supported the allegations of the Ministry of Home Affairs,\"" a CBI official, who requested anonymity, claimed. The operation, which started off in the morning, went on till late afternoon."""
"Mumbai:Β  The Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI today raided the home and office of activist Teesta Setalvad, who has been accused of illegally receiving funds from abroad. A team of 16 CBI officers carried out the raids in Mumbai. The search was on till late in the night. Ms Setalvad said she did not understand why the raids had been ordered when she had written to the CBI offering full cooperation with their inquiry. \This is vendetta by the BJP. They are trying to humiliate us,\"" she told NDTV. \""The Vyapam scam has killed 60-odd people, yet the CBI is busy with this,\"" she added, referring to the admission and recruitment scandal in Madhya Pradesh, which has seen an unusual number of deaths since 2012. Last week, the CBI registered a case against Ms Setalvad and her organisation Sabrang for alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act in receiving funds from abroad without seeking the home ministry's permission. In the First Information Report or FIR, the agency also named Ms Setalvad's husband Javed Anand and Gulam Mohammed Peshimam, both directors in Sabrang Communications and Publishing based in Santacruz, Mumbai. Ms Setalvad, who has for years worked for victims of the 2002 riots in Gujarat, alleges persecution by the ruling BJP.

"New Delhi:Β  The Indian arm of Ford Foundation, facing government scrutiny over alleged irregularities, is likely to get relief as it is ready to come under Indian laws even as the Home Ministry is considering its request for release of funds for paying its staffers' salaries. Top government sources said Ford Foundation, which was not registered in India, has expressed its willingness to register under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and not the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). \Since they do not receive any funds and just pass on funds that come from their parent organisation, we are ready to consider their request to register under FEMA,\"" sources said. Home Ministry is also examining a request by Ford Foundation that it be allowed to use funds to pay the salaries of its employees in India and meet other establishment expenses. \""We are examining it (the request),\"" sources said. Home Ministry had put Ford Foundation under the \""prior permission\"" list in April following allegations that it had donated funds to non-FCRA registered organisations and profit-making organisation. Both the acts are illegal under FCRA. Asked about the series of action taken by Home Ministry against various NGOs, sources said the government has only taken an initiative to ensure complete compliance with the law. \""Nothing more, nothing less. There is no crackdown,\"" sources said. Home Ministry has recently taken a series of actions against various NGOs, including Greenpeace India and two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, cancelled the registration of more than 10,000 NGOs and put Ford Foundation under \""prior permission\"".

"Mumbai, Maharashtra:Β  Social activist Teesta Setalvad's lawyers have hit out at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for calling her a threat to national security to a Mumbai Court yesterday. The agency was opposing the anticipatory bail of the activist in a case of alleged violations related to foreign funding of her NGOs. Ms Setalvad's lawyer, Vijay Hiremath told NDTV, \It's extremely ridiculous that she is a threat to national security. The documents that were seized have been earlier given to other investigation agencies as well. Also no foreign currency was found in the house.\"" The CBI had registered a case against Ms. Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on July 8.Β  The agency claims that Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited received around USD 2.9 lakh (Rs 1.8 crore) in donations from overseas in violation of FCRA. Ms. Setalvad had approached the court for anticipatory bail yesterday. The court granted her protection from arrest till July 21, when it will pass an order on the bail application. Her lawyers maintain that there was no violation of FCRA guidelines. According to rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it has been registered under FCRA. This donation was, therefore, a \""serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions which mandate funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration, Home Ministry had said while ordering a CBI probe.

It is unfortunate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is harassing and hounding NGOs. Probably, the partyβ€™s leaders do not realise that many of its members once themselves belonged to NGOs. When the Jana Sangh merged with the Janata Party after successfully resisting the authoritarian rule of Mrs Indira Gandhi, they were part of the struggle to uphold human rights, which the then ruling Congress Party had trampled upon mercilessly. How can those very people be anti-NGOs now? Accounts of voluntary organisations are audited and checked by the Finance Ministry on a regular basis. All foreign funds come through government channels. There is little scope for any hanky-panky. The change of procedure is nothing but harassment. Prior government sanction means an endless waiting for the urgently needed funds in the field where the activists work. I am surprised how the BJP has forgotten the probe against the Gandhi Peace Foundation was hauled over the coals after Mrs Gandhi came to power in 1980. The then Jana Sangh workers were chastised unnecessarily. The BJP is only a new avatar of the Jana Sangh, which took part in movements for the assertion of individuals' right to liberty and free speech.Β  I know both Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand. They enjoy an impeccable reputation for integrity. Their relentless fight against communal forces is the bright chapter in the annals of secularism. That the BJP is tilting towards the Hindu ideology is unfortunate, to say the least. But that does not mean those who are fighting against parochialism to underline the secular spirit of our Constitution should be getting the wrong end of the stick.Β  After winning freedom, the Constituent Assembly discussed many forms of governance. But what came to be supported by all sections of society was a secular polity. To undo that would mean mocking at the sacrifices which millions of people made to establish a democratic, secular republic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was reportedly behind the Gujarat riots which killed thousands of Muslims, has himself realised the futility of dividing society on a religious basis. It is a healthy development that Modi himself now publicly says β€sab ki sarkar, sab ka vikasβ€ (Everybodyβ€™s government for everybodyβ€™s progresses).Β  Unthinkingly some BJP members, who are under the influence of the RSS, are picking on members of minority communities and going to the extent of vandalising churches or indulging in conversions in the name of β€ghar wapsiβ€™. Modi should intervene at some stage to stop them from bringing a bad name to India which is admired for its spirit of tolerance and sense of accommodation. I remember a Jewsβ€™ delegation calling on me when I was India's High Commissioner at London. The delegates wanted to convey their gratefulness for the tolerance India had come to signify. They said that it was the only country in the world where the Jews had never faced any kind of discrimination. At that time New Delhi had not given recognition to Israel. Still they did not make any issue of it. What is disconcerting is that secularism, which should have deepened its roots by this time, has failed to do so. India has developed economically as it should have in the last 68 years since Independence. Maybe, a rapid economic development is the answer. In this context, the backwardness of villages testifies our failure. Farmers are the backbone of India's economy. But they are suffering the most. Their suicides indicate that the benefit of production has not reached them. Even a basic amenity like clean drinking water is a mirage.Β  Another farmer has committed suicide in a well-off state of Maharashtra. He is the ninth since March. The news from other states is too distressing. He cannot afford the rising cost of production from the farm. After a farmer from Rajasthan committed suicide at a public meeting in New Delhi, Indiaβ€™s capital, I thought that his death would touch the chord and the nation would focus seriously its attention on how to improve the plight of farmers. I must admit that I was wrong. There was a furore in Parliament all right. Prime Minister Modi too expressed his grief. Yet, it was business as usual soon after. The farmer was forgotten. I have not been able to draw up a blueprint on how to improve the farmers' lot. In fact, the introduction of the land acquisition Bill in Parliament showed that the corporate sector has had its way. Β  The concerns of the farmers, a pre-requisite, have been dropped. The matter has been pushed into the background. Even the Opposition's march, led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, is an event of the distant past. I do not have to remind that some 67 per cent of the people in the country depend on the fields which are increasingly becoming the killing fields.Β  Showing preference over the corporate sector, which no doubt provides jobs, will be against the ethos of the freedom struggle. Mahatma Gandhi focused attention on the people in the rural areas and moved from a bustling city to a small place Wardha, which later became an important town in the country.Β  NGOs are carrying on the work of the Mahatma. The sanction to some 900 NGOs has been withdrawn because they have not kept their accounts properly. The purpose of auditing their income should be to see whether there is an overall pilferage of funds. Expecting them to maintain accounts is not wrong. But checking even the last paisa spent is asking for a little too much because these activists are engaged in day-to-day work at the grassroots level.Β  The task which Teesta and Anand have embarked upon may not be to the liking of the ruling party because ideologically the two are poles apart. One stands for a composite society while the other is engaged in a task which is divisive. Both cannot coexist. The freedom was won for a secular democratic society and society should stay with that purpose.Β

CBI sources said in New Delhi that the case was registered after the agency completed verification of all the documents submitted by the Home Ministry while referring the probe to the agency. They said it is alleged that the accused named in the FIR, in a criminal conspiracy, accepted foreign contribution without registration and prior permission from the Union Home Ministry as mandated under FCRA norms. The government had earlier ordered a CBI probe into theΒ transfer of funds by US-based Ford Foundation to SCPPL and even froze a bank account of the firm on June 26. It was alleged that SCPPL violated rules of FCRA in accepting a donation of USD 2.9 lakh from Ford Foundation without getting clearance of the Home Ministry. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it is registered under FCRA. The donation was, therefore, a \""serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions which mandate funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration, the Home Ministry had said while ordering a CBI case. A bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, had also been frozen at the instruction of the Home Ministry. The Gujarat government had earlier asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by Setalvad. The fund transfer from Ford Foundation has, at present, to be cleared by a nodal official in the Home Ministry. In April, the government had ordered that funds from Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry. There are several cases in which the Gujarat government and Setalvad are waging legal battles. While she has filed several cases against the state government functionaries in connection with post-Godhra riots of 2002, the state police have filed a case of alleged embezzlement of funds against her.

Ahmedabad: After Teesta Setalvad, itβ€™s the turn of IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt who took on Gujarat govt to face the music. Bhatt has been under suspension since 2011 after he took on the then state government under Narendra Modi over the 2002 Gujarat riots. A 1988 batch IPS officer, Bhatt had filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court, claiming that he had attended a meeting on February 27, 2002 at Modiβ€™s residence in Gandhinagar, where he claimed the then CM allegedly told his officers to β€allow Hindus to vent their angerβ€. However, his claim was rejected by the Supreme Court appointed-Special Investigation Team, which probed nine major incidents related to the 2002 Godhra riots. Bhatt is also facing a couple of criminal cases. The Gujarat government has issued a show cause notice to suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt to explain within 10 days for allegedly having a β€relationship with a woman other than his wifeβ€. The notice was delivered on August 14, after the complaint was received along with a pen drive containing the 11-minute clip. The show cause notice was signed by A V Vala, undersecretary, Home Department, and stated that the forensic science laboratory in Gandhinagar had confirmed that the clipping was authentic and had not undergone any β€morphingβ€. The subject line of the forensic report, attached along with the notice, was β€Allegation against an IPS officer for having illicit relationship with a womanβ€. The report, however, did not specify that the person shown in the clip was Bhatt. β€The forensic result supports the complaint that Bhatt has (a) relationship with a woman other than his legally marriedβ€ wife, the notice stated, adding that β€this behaviour of Bhatt is unbecoming of an IPS officerβ€¦and a breach of All India Service Rulesβ€. When the Indian Express contacted Bhatt, he said he had replied to the notice on the day he received it, saying that the person in the clip was not him but β€someone who bears a general resemblanceβ€. In his reply, Bhatt stated that a β€closer examinationβ€ of the clipping β€reveals striking differences in facial features, including the shape and size of the nose, the shape and size of the forehead, as well as the shape and size of the earsβ€. β€In order to dispel any doubtsβ€, he added that he was willing to undergo β€Detailed Biometric Examination and Analysis at the Directorate of Forensic Science, Gujarat State or at any other similarly equipped facility of your choice, so as to facilitate proper and conclusive comparison between me and the person in the said videoβ€. Gujarat DGP P C Thakur said that he was not aware of the notice as he had been β€away and returned only todayβ€.
Washington, April 25 The US has expressed concern over Indiaβ€™s crackdown on funding to foreign NGOs operating in the countryβ€”- Ford Foundation and Greenpeace and said it was seeking a β€clarificationβ€. β€We are aware that the (Indian) Ministry of Home Affairs suspended the registration of Greenpeace India and has placed Ford Foundation on a prior permission watch list,β€ State Department Deputy Acting Spokesperson Marie Harf told reporters yesterday. β€We remain concerned about the difficulties caused to civil society organisations by the manner in which the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act (FCRA) has been applied,β€ she said in response to a question. β€We are concerned that this recent ruling limits the necessary and critical debate within Indian society and we are seeking a clarification with the appropriate Indian authorities,β€ Harf said. In a crackdown on foreign fundings to NGOs, the Union Home Ministry has put the Ford Foundation of the US on its β€watch listβ€ and ordered that all funds coming from the international organisation have to be routed only with its nod due to β€national security concernsβ€. The Home Ministry said it has decided to keep a watch on all activities funded by Ford Foundation because it wanted to ensure that funds coming from Ford Foundation are utilised for β€bonafide welfare activities without compromising on concerns of national interest and securityβ€. The move came after the Gujarat Government asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation as it alleged that the US-based organisation was β€interfering in the internal affairsβ€ of the country and also β€abetting communal disharmonyβ€ through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. Earlier this month, the Home Ministry had frozen seven bank accounts of Greenpeace India and barred it from receiving foreign funds for allegedly violating the FCRA and β€prejudiciallyβ€ affecting the countryβ€™s public and economic interests. β€” PTI
Sreenivasan Jain has made a transition from his traditional role of asking tough questions to people accused in various scams and scandals to defending such individuals using dubious means. We had shown earlier how Sreenivasan Jain had joined the Adarsh Liberal clique of journalists and formed a β€Teesta Defence Leagueβ€. Through his tweets Jain questioned the raids on Teesta and asked β€why this heavy handβ€ was used in dealing with Teestaβ€™s β€financial improprietyβ€, as if financial impropriety is some chhota- mota bomb blast which needs to be ignored. Sreenivasan Jain perhaps doesnβ€™t know that raids are one of the most common forms of tackling financial crimes, as Income Tax Department regularly carries out on tax evaders. Next, Jain asked for examples of CBI raids on NGOs, hoping that no such examples would come up and he can easily cry β€Teesta is being victimizedβ€: By CBI ? Of NGOβ€™s? Do cite examples. https://t.co/t7vnUVC0Db β€” Sreenivasan Jain (@SreenivasanJain) July 14, 2015 Smart Trolls swung in to action yet again, and showed him the Truth hidden in his Hype. This report from 2013 says 24 cases of NGOs suspected of flouting FCRA norms were referred to the CBI. This report from 2012 says 12 NGOs were under the CBI scanner for FCRA violations. If Jain himself admits that there could have been β€financial improprietyβ€ why does he want Teesta to get special treatment, when in the past numerous NGOs facing similar charges were under CBI investigation? And if Teesta is in fact completely innocent, why this reaction to a probe? Why is Jain so desperate to protect a person accused of corruption? Further, in his latest episode of Truth vs Hype, Jain moves to another person accused of β€financial improprietyβ€. He goesΒ to NCERT, where the Director, Parvin Sinclair, resigned from her post halfway into her tenureΒ over alleged financial irregularities. It is a convenient case for him because her Christian surname juxtaposed against Saffronization claims is easy propaganda material. In May 2012, under the non-victimizing, non-saffron UPA Government, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) recommended an inquiry against Sinclair based on allegations of irregularities in the purchase of paper worth Rs 50 crores. Outlook, at that time had reportedΒ that from the audit reports it had accessed it was evident that although rules said theΒ paper needs to be tested beforeΒ procurement, Sinclair hadΒ begun the process of allocating contracts before receiving the test reports itself. As the investigation went on, Sinclair put her side across, but the CVC wasnβ€™t satisfied. Since then, the issue had remained pending with the ministry without any action being taken. In any other circumstance, a neutral reporter would ask why the Government is sitting on a case of corruption and not taking any decision. But Sreenivasan Jain chose a different path. He tried to whitewash this scam, by glossing overΒ some selectedΒ facts, and straight away askedΒ Sinclair her version. She said to him: β€If I remember correctly and you will have to check the files, it was done simultaneouslyΒ (with the placing of order)β€ There you have it. The Director of NCERT herself admits that she began allocating contracts β€simultaneouslyβ€ even when the paper was being tested. Can anyone place an order for a product even when the product is not certified to be of standard quality?Β  Do you normally go to a clothes shop and purchase a shirt even when you are trying it on? A neutral journalist would have picked up this immediately, but Sreenivasan Jain did not. Secondly, she just relies on her memory, does not even try to say confidently that she had not broken rules, nor does she provide any documentary evidence. Even Jain never insists on any such evidence. If indeed she had a water-tight case, and Jain knew this, both of them would have made sure they present this to the public, to make it clear that Sinclair was victimized. But both of them did not go down this road and this is revealing. Well maybe for Jain, these were β€chhota-motaβ€ aberrations and he gave her a clean chit. He further says that the first topic HRD Minister Smrit Irani brought up in her meeting with the NCERT, was of this pending allegation. Instead of lauding a minister for taking action on a case of corruption, which was pending for unknown reasons with the ministry, Jain raises suspicion as to why this was the first topic. Hilarious. Jain then goes on to suggest that Sinclair might have been removed because the NCERT had almostΒ finished revising the curriculum, and that was not ideologically acceptable to the Government. But, he himself unknowingly punctures this argument saying that the curriculum revision was halted because the formulation of the New Education Policy, with NCERT andΒ wide-spread consultations was already under way, after 30 long years. Lastly, Jain digresses and says the original complaint was filed by Right Winger Dinanath Batra. Were Audit Reports saying Sinclair flouted rules also written by Batra? In his Truth vs Hype show, Jain also talks about the resignation of IIT Delhiβ€™s director Shevgaonkar, and again links it with Government Interference etc but never mentions that Shevgaonkar, who is rumoured to have written speeches for Rahul Gandhi, oversaw the signing of an MoU to set up an overseas campus of IIT Delhi, which was in complete violation of the IIT Act. Similarly he talks about the rejig of the council at ICHR, claiming leftists have been shunted out. But he fails to mention the irregularities at ICHR, under the earlier β€leftistβ€ councils, where crores of rupees were spent over a 9 volume book project which was started 26 years ago and is still going on. He also does not mention that people likeΒ Purabi Roy, a renowned scholar and historian who also happens to be the wife of a CPI MP in the Rajya Sabha, continue to be in the ICHR, along with UPA appointees likeΒ  Sachidananda Sahai. Thus over the past week or so, Sreenivasan Jain has been ultra defensive about Teesta Setalvad, who accepted illegal donations of $ 2.9 lakhs, has belittled a CVC probe into financial irregularities at NCERT, and ignored legal issues at IIT Delhi and ICHR, only to support his coterie and to claim the Government is either vindictive or interfering with institutions. It is only in Indian Mainstream media that we see journalists baying for the head of ministers for giving an NOC to a person accused of a financial scam, to meet his (edit) ailing wife, and the same journalists later defending and belittling the crimes of other people accused of financial impropriety with impunity.

By Irfan Engineer In an interview to CNNβ€™s Freed Zakaria ahead of his US visit, Prime Minister Modi said that Indian Muslims would live and die for India and would not want to do anything bad for India. (Express News Service, 2014). PM Modi while addressing a gathering at the Nazerbayev University in Astana, the capital of Kazakastan on 8th July 2015, underlined the common Islamic heritage of both Indian and Central Asia which, according to him, would always reject the forces of extremism. According to the Indian PM, the Islamic heritage of both India and Central Asia, founded on the principle of love and devotion, was defined by the highest ideals of Islam, viz. knowledge, piety, compassion and welfare. β€The dargahs of Delhi resonate with Sufi music that draws people from all faithsβ€, he said (PTI, 2015a), (PTI, 2015). The PM made similar statement earlier in Nay Pyi Taw delinking religion and terror (Sasi, 2014). Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh too claimed that Indian Muslims were patriots and that Islamic State (IS) had failed to attract themΒ (Bohra, 2015). However, in the year 2001, Narendrea Modi had claimed, β€All Muslims are not terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslimsβ€ (Varadarajan, 2002).[1] Later the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi used this statement extensively in his subsequent election campaigns. Following the 2002 massacre of Muslims and sexual assaults on Muslim women in many districts of Gujarat, there was anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic frenzy being whipped up by Gujarati Media. Modi did nothing to assuage this frenzy. His sadbhavana fasts came years later, and even then there were questions about his sincerity. Modi seemed to provide justification to the rioters committing mayhem on streets β€“ rioting, according to him, was a reaction to the action of burning S-6 compartment of Sabarmati Express which he had then concluded without police investigation to be a conspiracy of Muslims. Later the Gujarat police did prove the conspiracy before the trial court but the verdict is under appeal. The massacre of Muslims in Gujarat was followed a gaurav yatra undertaken by Modi invoking β€Gujarati prideβ€, which he claimed was hurt by the secularists who stigmatized all Gujaratis for the 2002 carnage. He would typically ask the people he was addressing β€“ β€Are you all murderers?β€ The next State Assembly elections after the riots were fought against not the opposition Congress Party, but β€the Mian Musharrafβ€ mentality of Muslims. Mian is a derogatory term used for Muslims and Musharraf was the then President of Pakistan. The term intended to signify that Muslims were loyal to Pakistan and both needed to be shown their place by the voters. While Modi was the Chief Minister of the state, Gujarat Police gunned down several Muslims alleging them to be terrorists belonging to outfits across the border. Murder of Sohrabuddin and Ishrat Jehan was later investigated and the then Home Minister of Gujarat β€“ Amit Shah and several police officers were accused of the offence. Prime Minister Modi is not offering any explanation as to which of his numerous assessments of Indian Muslims really represents his honest opinion? Or have his opinions changed? What new information he received which led to the change? Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh too had claimed in his address to the Directors-General of Police, Inspectors-General of Police and heads of Central Police Organisations in November 2014 that IS was trying to get a foothold in the Indian sub-continent, while Al-Qaeda had formed a branch for the Indian sub-continent keeping in view the Muslim population of Gujarat, Assam, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir and Bangladesh, and convert Indian sub-continent into Islamic State. Such a threat could not be taken lightly, though he hoped that Al-Qaeda was proved wrong (Talukdar, 2014). Indian Muslims and terrorism: Irrespective of answers to the above questions, it is true that Indian Muslims have contributed negligible human resources to the global terror networks. 140 million Indian Muslims is second largest population in the world, next only to Indonesia. Indian security forces and intelligence agency have so far been able to trace 4 youth who emigrated to join the war led by self appointed Islamic Khalifa β€“ Abu Bakr Baghdadi of IS. The four youth β€“ Areeb Majeed[2], Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Sheikh and Aman Tandel β€“ were from Kalyan. Honey trap and ideology misusing Islam were deployed to lure the youth. Areeb Majeed returned disappointed from the IS led war as the β€womanβ€ who was corresponding with him abruptly discontinued all the social media accounts that were being deployed to communicate with him. The well qualified youth were asked to do menial non-combatant jobs. What put off Areeb was the treatment of women by the IS combatants (Tiwary, 2014). Besides these 4 youth, there were reports of a 24 year old executive in an Indian multinational company and resident of Bengaluru β€“ Mehdi Masroor Biswas β€“ whoΒ  was accused of broadcasting ISβ€™s terror mission and luring recruits to fight in the Baghdadi led army through his twitter handle @ShamiWitness. Mehdi was tracked after he gave his interview to Channel 4. The intelligence agencies, having their own interests and training to suspect educated Muslim youth as terrorists on flimsy grounds, have claimed 20 youths from India are in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan fighting with the Islamic insurgents or at least providing assistance to them (Times News Network, 2015). Areeb claimed there were a few recruiters of IS in the country. Yet why are they failing so utterly? If such an utterly pitiable number of Muslim youth have been recruited for IS, what must be the reasons? Compare this with more than 20,000 foreigners from 90 countries, recruited to fight for the IS. 3,400 fighters were drawn from Western states, according to Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center β€“ 180 Americans according to National Intelligence Director James Clapper; 130 Canadians; 1,200 French fighters; 600 UK nationals β€“ 5 recruited every week; 50 Australians and 600 Germans (Berlinger, 2015), Β (Ward, 2015). Bangladesh too has only few recruits β€“ Hafizur Rahman, Asif Adnan, 26, Fazle Elahi Tanzil, 24, and three others were arrested by Bangladesh security agencies for being recruited to fight IS war Samiun Rahman aliasΒ Ibne Hamdan β€“ a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin was recruiting Bangladeshis from the northern city of Sylhet for IS war. Β He was targeting Muslims from Bangladesh as well as Myanmar (Hall, 2014). Police arrested Aminul Islam, IT head of a Coca Cola unit and Sakib Bin Kamal, a school teacher for recruiting 25 Bangladeshi youth for IS (Variyar, 2015). Why Indians havenβ€™t joined global terror networks? The Hindu nationalist organisations never took note of this fact. They stigmatized that all were terrorists were Muslims. Averments that Indian Muslims would not go against the interest of India and that they are patriots have been basically made during visits to Muslim dominated countries or while speaking to foreign media to project moderate image. However, the issue is why Indian Muslims havenβ€™t? Let us list down some probable reasons: 1)Β Β Β Β Β  The religious leadership of Indian Muslims is largely drawn from the seminary Darul Uloom Deoband, and other seminaries too e.g., Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow. The Darul Uloom Deoband controls thousands of small seminaries and chain of madrasas and maktabas. Ulama of Deoband, organized into Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, have issued fatwa during a meeting attended by thousands of clerics and students on the Ramlila Grounds in Delhi against terrorism. They vowed to wipe out terrorism. According to the rector Habibur Rehman β€Islam rejects all kinds of unjust violence, breach of peace, bloodshed, murder and plunder and does not allow it in any formβ€. Jamiat held a series of conferences and meetings with madrassas in Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Surat, Varanasi and Kolkata to carry forward the anti-terror movement (Majumdar, 2008), (TNN, 2008). The Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind booked entire train and scores of their members and supporters travelled giving message of peace and opposing terrorism. However, Indian clerics are not the only ones to issue fatwa against terrorism. Such fatwas have been issued by other clerics as well, e.g. by Maulana Tahirul Quadri, a Pakistani cleric of Minhajul Quran now based in Canada. Religious leadership of Muslims in US and other countries also have issued such fatwas. 2)Β Β Β Β Β  By and large Islam spread its influence in India by peaceful preaching. The first encounter with Islam was through Arab traders on the coast of Kerala in the 7th Century. As a result, Muslims retain their local traditions and culture and share the common heritage with non-Muslims. To give just a few instances, Muslims in Lakshadweep follow matrilineal traditions Β (Dube, 1994). Onam is as important a festival for Muslims as for non-Muslims in Kerala. Amir Khusroβ€™s compositions on Holy, Maulana Hasrat Mohaniβ€™s Β regular visits to Mathura and love of Lord Krishna, Ras Khanβ€™s compositions on Krishna, Bismillah Khanβ€™s shehnai dedicated to Lord Shiva and Dara Shikhoβ€™s translations of Upanishads in Persian are just a few of many diverse instances of shared cultural traditions before Britishers encouraged communal divisions. Islamic influence in India largely grew on account of inclusive sufi traditions which served, fed and attracted the most marginalized and excluded sections of the society. Love was the basic religion the sufi (and bhakti) saints knew. The sufi doctrine is based on wahadatul wujud β€“ unity of being β€“ all beings are one and creation of God. Sufis also believed in suh-i-kul β€“ total peace β€“ embracing everyone. Peace within oneself and with external environment. Sulhi-i-kul is to be achieved by denying oneself all unnecessary selfish desires, fears (accept that of Allah), needs (accept basic ones needed to keep oneβ€™s body and soul together), urges, greeds, etc. Nizamuddin Auliya would sing bhajans daily morning in praise of Lord Rama and Krishna. Aartis by Hindu women are part of traditions during the tazia procession in many towns and villages. Given these cultural roots and cultural consciousness, it is difficult, if not impossible, to convince Indian Muslim mind with ideology of jihad. Sufi ethos is ingrained in the Muslim consciousness. A common Muslim finds little common in culture of Arabs and Muslims of other countries. The wahabi-salafi Islamic traditions spend considerable resources and efforts to Arabize Muslims under the pretext of following β€correct traditionsβ€™ in accordance with Islam. However, their success is limited. Limited to the extend Muslims are excluded and made to feel alien, experience discrimination and suffer communal violence. Volumes have been written on the composite and shared regional culture across religious following. The growth of Hindu nationalists and their discourse would sadly contribute to Muslims turning to Arabization if only in search of unity amidst diversity of cultural traditions and language within the community. The feeling of alienation is much higher among the Muslims in some of the western countries. Most of them are from Asian origin and feel less at home in western cultures. Asians prefer to stay in neighbourhoods dominated by their own communities. Cultural alienation among youth, growth of racist forces which target Islam informed by β€clash of civilizationβ€™ theory and participation of western armies in war against Iraq and Afghanistan create more conducive environment for Islamist to recruit youth for their war. 3)Β Β Β Β Β  Urge to take revenge has been one reason for the Muslim youth in India to undertake terrorist activities. The March 12, 1993 bombs, bomb attacks in Zaveri bazaar and several other places on 18th March 2003, the bomb blasts in Ghatkopar BEST bus on 28th July 2003, terror attack in several suburban trains on 11th July, 2006 in Mumbai are some instances where Muslim youth were involved. However, that was out of desire to take revenge for 1992-93 communal violence in Mumbai and 2002 carnage in Gujarat. Several accused convicted for the offences relating to 12th March 1993 bomb blasts said in their statements during the trial that they participated in the conspiracy as they saw their near and dear ones being killed during the 1992-93 riots in Mumbai. Β Justice Srikrishna (1998) in his report states links the communal riots and the bomb blasts with the following words: β€One common link between the riots β€¦ and bomb blasts of 12th March 1993 appears to be that the former appear to have been a causative factor for the latter. β€¦ The serial bomb blasts were a reaction to the totality of events at Ayodhya and Bombay in December 1992 and January 1993.β€™ The resentment among large number of Muslim youth was exploited by the Pakistani agencies. However, democracy in India is working much better than in many other Muslim countries. Though justice is slow, with human rights crusaders like Teesta Setalvad and other organizations, it was possible to get justice for the victims of Gujarat riots. Some accused were convicted and are behind bars. Those accused of Ishrat Jahan and Sohrabuddin case are still facing trial. Extra judicial murders by security forces have come down drastically with all such murders being problematized by human rights organizations. Given the hope for justice, there is less desire for revenge and hence negligible success of the IS recruiters in India. The democratic space for the marginalized is shrinking in India. It is under attack from a section of Hindu nationalists who have been emboldened to stigmatize Muslims and other minorities with calls to take away their right to vote, instigating them by calling them to go to Pakistan, calling madrasas as den of terrorism. Shrinking of democratic space and victimization of human right activists like Teesta Setalvad is cause for worry. Will we able to ward off IS and keep Muslim youth from terrorism for long? The democratic forces within the community seem to be strong enough. However, all marginalized sections would have to come together to defend and deepen democracy in India. β€”β€“ [1] The averment β€all Muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are Muslimsβ€ was made by Narendra Modi during a TV debate programme β€The Big Fightβ€, in which Siddharth Varadarajan too was a participant.

Besides working on National Rural Health Mission, the organization works with over 300 other NGOs, the priest added. Top government officials said that more than 100 NGO are likely to face similar action and another 1,000 odd are being investigated The federal Home Ministry has asked to all states to direct all financial institutions, including banks in their jurisdiction, to keep a close watch on foreign funding to NGOs. Sources have told NDTV that the ministry is investigating over 1,000 NGOs for allegedly misusing foreign funds. In April, the US-based charity Ford Foundation was also placed on the watch-list stopped from funding local organizations without permission. But action against Caritas Internationalis may have diplomatic fallout. NGOs and lobby groups have been on the governmentβ€™s radar since a report last year by the Intelligence Bureau said they had been stalling economic growth by campaigning against power projects, mining and genetically modified food. The home ministry sent notices to 12,000 NGOs earlier this year. Most NGOs under scanner seem to be those working among tribal and dalit people who oppose big transnational firmsβ€™ attempt to displace them from their habitat. β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦β€¦No ratings yet. β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€”β€“ Rate this Story:    
"Mumbai:Β  Activist Teesta Setalvad has recorded her statement before the CBI in connection with a case against her firm for allegedly receiving around US $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). She had been asked by a local court to appear before the central agency by Tuesday as on Friday special CBI Judge Anis Khan had reserved an order on the anticipatory bail applications filed by Ms Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand till Tuesday while granting them interim protection from arrest. The CBI, which registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited, has alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. The CBI sleuths searched four places including premises owned by Ms Setalvad, Mr Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and the office of SCPPL on July 14. The probe agency had opposed the bail plea contending the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected \interference towards the internal security and activities of India\"" and also contested Ms Setalvad's claim that the money received was a fee for consultancy. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation (a US-based NGO) and SCPPL was seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants. There is no mention of any 'consultancy' therein,\"" the CBI told the court. The CBI, which is probing the firm's accounts from 2004 to 2014, claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money received from the Ford Foundation had not been cleared by the Home Ministry. Ms Setalvad, during the July 14 searches by CBI, had termed the action by the probe agency as a \""shameful political vendetta\"". \""The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27 2015. The Naroda Patiya appeals (Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) are being heard in the Gujarat High Court tomorrow. This is nothing but a bid to subvert the cause of public justice and ensure that no justice happens in these cases,\"" she had said in a statement. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only if it has FCRA registration. The donation was, therefore, a \""serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions, the Home Ministry had said while ordering a CBI probe. A bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, had also been frozen under instructions from the Ministry. The Gujarat government had asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by Ms Setalvad. The Home Ministry had forwarded the complaint to the CBI, which then filed the case after verification. In April, the government had ordered that funds from Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to an Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry.

Comments Written by Satish Jha | Ahmedabad | Published:December 7, 2014 4:50 am The Gujarat Government had offered Rs 7.5 lakh per appearance to senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani, son former law minister Ram Jethmalani, as special public prosecutor in the Gujarat HC to oppose the anticipatory bail application of Mumbai-based activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and three others, who are booked allegedly for siphoning off funds meant for the 2002 riots victims. Jethmalani is learnt to have refused the fee and volunteered to assist the state. In a letter dated December 4, accessed by this newspaper, Jethmalani, has informed the principal secretary, home department β€β€¦I wish to inform you that I waive my appearance fee in the matter as also clerical charges of 10% on the total bill amount as also conference/drafting charges as per government normsβ€¦β€ However, he has asked the government to take care of his travelling and accommodation expenses. On November 13, the state legal department passed a resolution, stating that Jethmalani Junior will be given Rs 7.50 lakh per appearance.Β  In January, the DCB, Ahmedabad, had registered an FIR against Setalvad and others for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore meant for converting Gulberg Society into a riots museum, a project which was not materialised.

Only when she consents to β€zehn ki lootβ€™ (plunder of reason), when she agrees to subordinate her own reason to the whim and diktat of her husband, and deny the self-evident truth, does she achieve approval as a suitable wife. We, the people of India, are being similarly tamed of our β€shrewishβ€™ behaviour, with propaganda and public shaming in TV studios accomplishing the β€zehn ki lootβ€™. It is a process that seeks to bully us into declaring that the sun is the moon, that night is day, that β€khula jhoothβ€™ (open lie) is in fact the only truth. Refuse to part with your reason, and you are chastised for β€bad behaviourβ€™. I would like to revisit the #GovtVsNGO News Hour show on Times Now, on 17th February, as a particularly glaring instance (Activism or Anti-nationalism, Parts 1 and 2 ) The topic of the show was the Government of Indiaβ€™s decision to deplane a Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai from a London-bound flight, because she was planning to depose before British MPs about the violation of Indiaβ€™s forest rights laws by a British mining company, Essar, in Mahan in Madhya Pradesh. Echoing the Government of India (GoI) affidavit, the anchor Arnab Goswami repeated, ad nauseam, his allegation that it was β€anti-nationalβ€™ for Priya Pillai, as an Indian citizen, to depose before a foreign governmentβ€™s parliamentary committee. The issue was not one of free speech or the right to dissent from Government opinion, he declared, but one of patriotism and national interest. The GoI affidavit claims that allowing Priya to depose before UK Parliamentarians would put India at risk of sanctions. If this is indeed true, then the GoI should similarly put every Indian who has deposed before foreign parliaments, especially every Indian who has specifically advised anti-India sanctions, on a No-Fly list. Has it? Arvind Subramanian had, in March 2013, given testimony to the US Congress, advising the US to initiate WTO disputes against India, unless India agreed to rewrite its patent law. India is the worldβ€™s top supplier of affordable generic versions of drugs (for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, etc) under patent. Subramanianβ€™s prescriptions will inevitably put these drugs out of reach for crores of poor Indian patients. In March 2014, Subramanian submitted his testimony to the US Congress in writing: β€If India does not address the problems created by Section 3(d) of the patent legislation or by compulsory licensing for nonworking, the United States should consider initiating WTO disputes against India.β€ Did the Modi Government put Subramanian on a No-Fly list? No. They appointed him as Chief Economic Adviser. Why one rule for Arvind Subramanian, and another for Priya Pillai? Surely these double standards prove that the issue is indeed one of free speech and right to disagree with oneβ€™s Government? Any professional anchor would have conceded that this question is valid, and would at least have taken the trouble to put this question to the BJP spokesperson and other pro-Government and pro-IB voices on the panel. Β  But Arnab Goswami instead heckled and tried to drown out this question from the get go. And he refused to concede, even once, that this question was worth asking and deserved an answer. He even failed to admit that the Times of India, print counterpart of his own channel, had carried this story titled β€Modiβ€™s chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian had opposed India on IPR till recentlyβ€ Corporate Interest =Government Interest = National Interest? What does the contrast between the Governmentβ€™s attitude towards Arvind Subramanian and Priya Pillai tell us, then? Subramanian is an Indian who deposed before US Congress, egging the US to take action against India, unless India stops safeguarding the access of poor Indian citizens to affordable medicines, and agrees instead to sacrifice crores of Indian lives to the greed of US Big Pharma. Why is he the Modi Governmentβ€™s favoured choice to frame Indiaβ€™s economic policies? The same Modi Government claims that Priya Pillai is a β€threat to national securityβ€™ and an β€anti-nationalβ€™ because she wants to tell UK MPs that a UK mining company is violating Indiaβ€™s Forest Rights laws to grab adivasi land and rob more than 50,000 adivasis in Mahan, Madhya Pradesh, of their forest, land and livelihood! To any reasonable Indian, shouldnβ€™t national interest lie in defending Indiaβ€™s own laws (on Forest Rights or Patents)? Doesnβ€™t it lie in defending laws enacted to protect the right of Indiaβ€™s poor adivasis to land and forests, and the rights of poor patients to affordable medicines? Isnβ€™t this what Priya Pillai and other activists are doing? Or does national interest lie in allowing MNCs like Vedanta and Essar to break laws, and loot Indian adivasisβ€™ land, forests and livelihood? Does it lie in helping US drug corporations to raise drug prices steeply, thus leaving crores of Indians to die of curable diseases for lack of affordable drugs? For this is what the Government of India, aided by the likes of Arvind Subramanian, is doing. The Land Grab ordinance promulgated by the Modi Government proves this, as does the fact that the Modi Government has revoked National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) guidelines, effectively preventing it from capping prices of patented drugs in the future. Clearly, in the light of our β€zehnβ€™, our reason, it is the activists like Pillai who are defending the rights of Indians β€“ rights that the Government of India is trampling on in order to appease foreign corporations, foreign funding agencies like the IMF and World Bank, and imperialist Governments.Β Β  But no, there was no room even for this opinion to be given a decent hearing on News Hour. In the show, the β€NGOsβ€™ and β€activistsβ€™ were β€anti-nationalsβ€™ and the Government as protecting national interest by preventing them from speaking to β€foreignβ€™ parliamentary committees. Reason must be turned on its head β€“ and anyone who dared voice a reasonable argument, must be shouted down, heckled, turned into a verbal punching bag. If you, as anchor, shout β€anti-nationalβ€™ or its variants enough times and enact derision and mockery with enough authority, anyone daring to argue with you is already always going to look and sound β€guiltyβ€™. And if your guests surprise you by putting up a fight and giving punches as good as they get, you can declare them guilty of β€bad behaviourβ€™! If you, as anchor, can effectively ensure that reasonable arguments are drowned in the cacophony of castigation, you can hope to achieve β€zehn ki lootβ€™ β€“ you can hope to bully your guests and viewers into feeling that the sun is actually the moon. β€Patrioticβ€™ = Parties Take Blood Money from Killer Corporations? The BJP and Congress units of Madhya Pradesh had both accepted money from Vedanta and Dow corporations in violation of FCRA. Again, here is the TOI report on this fact Again, the Delhi HC found BJP and Congress in violation of FCRA for accepting funds from Vedanta and other foreign corporations You would imagine that anyone anchoring a β€debateβ€™ on foreign funding trumping national interest, would mention this fact. Or at least allow others to mention it. Especially since MP is the state where the Mahan struggle is taking place, given that the Bhopal disaster happened in MP. Should it not be asked why MPβ€™s ruling and Opposition parties are accepting funds from killer foreign MNCs instead of standing by tribals and victims of those corporations? You would expect at least one single question to the BJP spokesperson on why itβ€™s β€patrioticβ€™ to get funded by Dow (a company that has the blood of the Bhopal Gas Disaster victims on its hands) and Vedanta (a company that, facilitated by Indian Governments, tried to grab adivasi forest land at Niyamgiri). Instead, Satinath Sarangi, who has long battled for justice for the Bhopal victims was branded as unpatriotic and anti-national on the show, by the anchor! History Lessons in Colonialism But the ultimate β€zehn ki lootβ€™ was when the anchor chose to lecture the activists on the history of British colonialism and anti-colonial resistance in India. To summarise his rant: β€You activists have no self respect, because you seek justice from Britain that once colonised us. You need a history lesson in our freedom struggle. Have you heard of Birsa Munda?β€™ etcβ€¦ This is truly mystifying, and would be almost funny, except that this isnβ€™t some troll on Twitter saying it, it is an anchor with a leading TV channel who enjoys the power to (try to) shape and remould public memory and history. Who are the modern-day counterparts of the East India Company and colonial Raj? Vedanta and Essar that are grabbing adivasi land in Niyamgiri and Mahan, and the Governments that facilitate this grab? Or the activists who protest such land grab? Letβ€™s consider. During the British Raj, the East India Company, and later, other entities were allowed to plunder resources on Indian soil and to exploit the labour of the people. To protect British trade, Indian peasants were forced to grow indigo, adivasis were slaughtered for defending their proprietary right over forests and land. Tilka Majhi, Sidhu Kanhu, Birsa Munda, Kana Bhagat led valiant struggles that forced the British to enact historic acts such as Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act (1908) and Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act (1912), to protect the land rights of adivasis. When, today, these laws and other laws such as PESA and the Forest Rights Act are violated freely by Indian and foreign corporations; when adivasis protesting such violations are gunned down by police and paramilitary as their historic heroes were, the adivasis themselves say that colonial plunder is being re-enacted. Speak to adivasis anywhere in the country, and they will call state and central Governments that facilitate their eviction from β€jal jangal zameenβ€™ as the β€Company Rajβ€™ β€“ i.e a re-enactment of the British East India Company. Β  Peasants all over India are protesting the Land Grab Ordinance promulgated by the Modi Sarkar, whom they too freely dub as β€Company Sarkarβ€™ β€“ the Government that, like the British Government, is an agent of the β€Companyβ€™; that protects corporations. Modi should know this, even voters in Delhi have used the term β€Company Sarkarβ€™ to describe their unease with Modiβ€™s pro-big business image. This sense of history, of the linkages between anti-colonial resistance against the British and struggles of adivasis and peasants against corporate land grab today is obvious to any peasant in India, any adivasi in India. But according to Goswamiβ€™s history lesson, it is those who represent those struggles that are a throwback to the β€Company Rajβ€™, not the Governments that are funded by, and act as agents of, Indian and foreign corporations! Just days ago, the Times Now reported on a protest by adivasis in Bastar that, again, brought back spectres of the colonial Raj. Adivasis had surrounded the police station in Tongpal, demanding the release of 10 villagers who had been picked up by the police. The Chhattisgarh police has a long history of custodial torture of villagers β€“ no wonder the villagers feared for the safety of the 10 people. To justify arbitrary arrests, torture and killing, the Chhattisgarh police routinely accuse the villagers as β€Maoistsβ€™. Times Now, that was teaching us the history of Birsa Munda, described the 1000 villagers gathered there as an mob β€armed with bows and arrowsβ€™ that was demanding β€release of Maoist cadresβ€™ β€“ i.e the channel echoed the police version. The channel made no effort to speak to a single one of those adivasi protesters, to ask them for their version of events. We wonder if the historian-anchor-editor remembers that Birsa and his warriors too were described by the British as a bunch of bloodthirsty rebels armed with bows and arrows? That then, as in now, bows and arrows are no match for police fire-power? Adivasis protesting at a thana or gathered to protect a field or forest β€“ this is a familiar precursor to a long saga of police massacres. Adivasis killed in police firing at Koel Karo, Kalinganagar, Narayanpatna, Muthanga were all branded as Maoists, β€Naxalsβ€™ and so on. When news channels brand adivasis as β€Maoistsβ€™ without even bothering to speak to them, they are setting up the scene for more such massacres. A Ridiculous and Sinister Government Affidavit The Government affidavit and arguments in court to justify imposing conditions on Priya Pillaiβ€™s travel outside India range are both ridiculous and sinister. The affidavit claims that if Priya Pillai were to depose before a UK Parliamentary panel, this would lead to a β€false depictionβ€ of β€Indiaβ€™s effortβ€ to β€protectβ€ the rights of the tribal community. This could send wrong signals when the central government β€is inviting foreign businesses to invest in Indiaβ€, and it could even lead to sanctions against India. The Indian Government, with the might and authority of the State on its side, is free to speak to the British Government. British, American and other Governments send their leaders to India, accompanied by a posse of corporations from those countries, trying to get India to weaken its labour, environment and land acquisition laws so that those corporates can β€make in Indiaβ€™ on the cheap. Why fear a single activist speaking to a handful of British MPs? The Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain explained to the High Court that this was because of the β€doodh mein makkhiβ€ theory β€“ a single fly in the milk might be insignificant on its own, but it can make the whole bowl of milk undrinkable. So, if we allow our activists to speak of human rights violations in an international forum, it may have a β€global cascading effectβ€ and allow developed countries to cripple development in India. Whatβ€™s the truth? Our Governments, including the Modi Government, the UPA Government, and most state Governments, have gone out of the way to assure these Governments and their corporations (and our own) that India can provide β€low cost man powerβ€™ (Modiβ€™s words at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit Β  β€“ a euphemism for cheap, ill-paid, bonded labour and cheap lives. The interests of the Governments of India and those of the UK or US, mesh perfectly well with those of US, UK and Indian corporations β€“ they are all agreed on the need to allow corporations to violate laws protecting workers, peasants and safety and health of Indian citizens. Bhopal is a stark example of this cosy coalescing of the interests of Carbide-Dow, the US and Indian Governments, and Indian corporations. Leading Indian corporations have helped to organise secret meetings of politicians with Carbide-Dow, to facilitate Dowβ€™s β€rehabilitationβ€™ and re-entry into India. But yes, when activists and peopleβ€™s movements seek to hold the corporations accountable to Indian laws and international human rights standards, raising their voice in India as well as the host country of the corporations, they do become β€doodh mein makkhiβ€™ for the Governments and corporations that would like all the β€malaiβ€™ to themselves. Hence, the attempts to harass and witch-hunt activists, so as to throw these inconveniently buzzing, noisy β€fliesβ€™ out of the corporate cream bowl! Β This reportΒ  in β€First Postβ€™ argues that the Governmentβ€™s affidavit and arguments is β€the stuff of political satire β€“ the kind spoofing a tinpot dictatorship a la Woody Allenβ€™s Bananasβ€ and pointing out that β€the jokes begin to wear thin when we recognise why the words β€madβ€™ and β€dictatorβ€™ go so well together. The arbitrary and unpredictable use of power is the essence of dictatorship. That our government can so willfully and ludicrously wield power is no laughing matter, after all.β€ The worst β€jokeβ€™ is that the Government knows full well that Priya can and has deposed in the UK by Skype. All this effort is not really to prevent her from deposing. It is to harass, victimise, intimidate, malign. The purpose is propaganda, to turn common sense on its head and brand the committed activists as anti-nationals and the anti-national Government as patriotic. And thatβ€™s where the role of the TV-show comes in. Goswami acted as a loudspeaker for the Government affidavit, failing to raise β€“ or allow anyone else to raise β€“ a single question about this affidavit or the Governmentβ€™s preposterous arguments. Among the questions that could not be asked: How can the Government claim that Priya will give UK MPs a β€false depictionβ€ of β€Indiaβ€™s effortβ€ to β€protectβ€ the rights of the tribal community? What is the β€true depictionβ€? Is it not true that a High Level Committee on the Status of Tribals has submitted a scathing and well-documented report, pointing out that the policies of liberalisation and land grab have increased the yawning gulf between adivasis and Indiaβ€™s privileged citizens? Read a summary of the report here The Government affidavit argues that patriotic activists would highlight the violations of adivasisβ€™ rights only in Indian institutions β€“ an argument the anchor also made aggressively. Well, when Indian activists and experts prepared this painstaking report on adivasis and submitted it to the Indian Government, why did the Government suppress the report? According to the story linked above, β€Several of the reportβ€™s recommendations go against some of the changes the government is undertaking or contemplating to push for faster and easier industrialisation. The report, a comprehensive review of the socio-economic status of the 700-odd tribal communities of the country, has been kept under wraps since May 2014 when it was submitted to the government.β€ The Report states what Priya, and indeed any genuine activist, would argue in every possible forum: that β€Laws and rules that provide protection to tribes are being routinely manipulated and subverted to accommodate corporate interests. Tribal protests are being met with violence by the Stateβ€™s paramilitary forces and the private security staff of corporations involved.β€ The Government affidavit claims that Priyaβ€™s action of deposing before UK MPs would be anti-national, whereas it approvingly names a series of activists who have raised issues and protested nationally but not compromised national interest by speaking on international forums. This is especially hilarious, given that among the β€goodβ€ activists cited are Medha Patkar and Nandini Sundar. The BJP and its Chhattisgarh Government has claimed that Nandini Sundar is a β€Maoistβ€™ because she raised human rights violations of Bastar adivasis in the Supreme Court. The IB report that was the pretext for targeting Greenpeace in the first place, also named Medha Patkar as an evil foreign-funded NGO that posed a threat to national security. Forget activists who approach Courts; even parties (including mine) that contest elections and give the BJP a tough time electorally, are jeered at as β€Naxalsβ€™ and advised to go to jungles. So, which forum is truly patriotic? If you tell British MPs that a British corporation is violating Indian laws, youβ€™ll be told thatβ€™s anti-national, raise the matter in Courts. If you raise it in Courts, youβ€™ll be taunted as anti-national too, because, they say, patriotism lies in keeping police and security forces above courts. The PM will advise adivasis from the ramparts of the Red Fort to contest elections and give up the bullet for the ballot. But if you contest elections, the same man will ask you to go to the jungles and be a Naxal! Goswami kept taunting Greenpeace for calling β€foreign protest expertsβ€™ to advise them. Well, most of us β€“ including Satinath, John and myself certainly β€“ are well known β€protest expertsβ€™, 100% made in India! But the question is, if the Government can appoint US-based men who have spoken for the USA, lobbying against India to β€adviseβ€™ them, whatβ€™s wrong with β€foreignβ€™ members of an international organization (Greenpeace) advising their Indian unit? If the foreign corporations are welcome in India, why on earth should β€foreignβ€™ activists be taboo? Misogyny Much? Β Women are shamed daily for raising β€family mattersβ€™ (such as domestic violence or rape) outside the family, in courts; they are accused of lacking a proper sense of izzat (honour). The Government (and Goswami) say that human rights activists who raise issues of violations of the rights of tribals, Dalits or minorities in international forums, should be β€ashamedβ€™ and should have more β€self-respectβ€™. In other words, they seek to imply that activists β€ne duniya ke saamne hamaari naak kaat diβ€™ (they have shamed India internationally). Goswami conducted a McCarthy-like interrogation of John Dayal, asking him if he deposed β€against Indiaβ€™ at a US Congress sub-committee. John said β€Noβ€™. When Goswami then asked if he had not deposed before a US Congress sub-committee on religious freedom in 2000, he said β€Yesβ€™. β€Gotchaβ€™ claimed Goswami, asking why he had said β€Noβ€™ a minute ago. John stated the obvious β€“ that to speak and fight against religious discrimination in India is an act of deep love for India; that to criticise Indian Governments for 1984 or 1992 is not to β€speak against Indiaβ€™; that it is the perpetrators of the massacres that are β€against Indiaβ€™! For instance, American activists and whistleblowers who have spoken out internationally and in the US against racism and US-sponsored wars and occupation have done their country proud β€“ unlike their Presidents and their armies who have instead shamed the US. Goswami displayed his utter ignorance of John Dayal, the man and the activist, when he accused John of being an apologist for racism or religious discrimination in the US. He also kept saying that the US, would not β€allowβ€™ their citizen to thus β€speak against the USβ€™ internationally. The interesting thing is, just half an hour before this show, Goswami anchored a show on racism and attacks on religious freedom in the US. On that show, his chosen β€Americanβ€™ voices mostly defended the US establishment. Had he called any of the thousands of β€Black Lives Matterβ€™ protesters β€“ all American citizens who would have excoriated the racism of the US establishment β€“ he would have held them to be β€unpatrioticβ€™ Americans! But Goswami preferred to call only the cardboard cut-out figures who are β€patrioticβ€™ to the US establishment. The ex-Army man Bakshi also referred to the Arab Spring as unpatriotic and foreign-funded. Clearly, these men hold any anti-establishment peopleβ€™s movement anywhere in the world, that topple dictators and assert peopleβ€™s rights, to be β€unpatrioticβ€™ whether raised in foreign parliaments or on their own native soil! Β  Dalits who took the issue of caste-based discrimination to a United Nations-organised conference on racism at Durban, were also accused of breaking faith with the country by raising an β€internal matterβ€™ on an international forum. Should India be proud of oppressing Dalits, or of the activists who challenge and expose such oppression? Has the Indian Government and Times Now never heard of international human rights laws? There is no contradiction whatsoever between pursuing the cause of justice in the countryβ€™s own institutions as well as in international forums. It is possible, indeed necessary to ask the Indian Supreme Court to uphold human rights; to ask Indian parliamentarians to enact and implement laws that are accountable to international standards of human rights; to ask parliaments of other countries to hold their own corporations accountable to international standards of human rights; and to raise human rights violations issues on international forums β€“ all at the same time. According to Goswami, patriotic Indians must not seek justice in institutions of other countries β€“ not even against foreign corporations. Well, is it not strange that Obama and the US Nuke companies also agree with Goswami? India has secretly assured the US that they will β€read downβ€™ Indiaβ€™s civil nuke liability law, to ensure that Indian victims of a nuclear accident cannot sue US nuke suppliers in US courts. Is it because Goswami too believes such an action to be unpatriotic, that he decided that the Nation (or at least the News Hour) did not really need to seek to know about these details of the Nuke Deal? The language used by the pro-Government panelists as well as Goswami to harangue activists were also very much in the patriarchal framework of β€honourβ€™. An ex-RAW officer RSN Singh told the two women on the panel β€madam, ladies should behave themselvesβ€™. Goswami accused me of β€bad behaviour on televisionβ€™ and repeatedly asked me to β€have some self-respectβ€™. He told me repeatedly to β€calm downβ€™, β€drink waterβ€™ and β€behave myselfβ€™ β€“ all phrases very often by people to put women down by suggesting that they are irrational and hysterical. But, even as Major General Bakshi and RSN Singh both literally frothed at the mouth, and bared their teeth, (an observer describes this here), Goswami never told them to β€calm downβ€™. They are macho, militaristic men, yes, with a divine right to testosterone-powered righteous rants? Combative male anchors are admired for their machismo, for being judgemental, for interrupting and heckling their guests constantly, for telling the nation what (according to them) it wants to know. Women (or non-macho, truly β€gentleβ€™ men like John Dayal) who suggest that perhaps they too have something to say that the nation might want to know, are shamed and silenced for being ill-behaved. There is no similar attempt, though, to discipline or put a leash on (male) guests who rabidly shout β€free sexβ€™ and β€naxaliteβ€™ at female guests! Those words donβ€™t ring any alarm bells for the macho anchors β€“ but John Dayal is attacked for muttering β€filthyβ€™ in reaction to allegations of being β€anti-nationalβ€™. Is it not indeed filthy to allow one of Indiaβ€™s leading human rights campaigners to be branded as β€anti-nationalβ€™ on prime time TV? That said, assertive women throughout history have been accused of β€bad behaviourβ€™. They do say, donβ€™t they, that well-behaved women seldom make history? I could add, that β€good behaviourβ€™ makes women more vulnerable to abuse, to violence, to loss of freedom, health, even life. We women, we activists, are β€badly behavedβ€™ indeed, and proud of it. We are indeed the β€makkhisβ€™ in the corporate malai that the BJP and Congress would like to relish in peace. We are proud of this. And we are proud too, of the fact that we build international networks of solidarity. We count ourselves among the Edward Snowdens, the Chelsea Mannings β€“ all those activists who make their people proud, however much their own Governments might try to brand them as β€unpatrioticβ€™. I should mention that the News Hour is not the only news show where the β€zehn ki lootβ€™ is played out. I attended one debate on News X recently on the witch-hunt of Teesta Setalvad, which followed the same format of discourteous, stentorian heckling of any voice that differed with the anchorβ€™s opinion. I have written briefly about that β€zehn ki lootβ€™ here. The anchor on News X too chose to accuse me of bad behaviour, of β€not allowing the anchor to do his jobβ€™. Free Speech and An Accountable Media Β  Many friends and well-wishers, horrified by the News Hour show, have asked why we didnβ€™t get up and leave. Thatβ€™s easily answered. We would not give the bully the satisfaction of being able to claim he had ousted us or shamed us into leaving β€“ and this is how he would have construed a walk-out. On 18th February again, the News Hour conducted a repeat of the same theme, with Kavita Srivastava this time at the receiving end of the completely undemocratic heckling. Why, knowing this is likely to happen, did activists go on the show? We go, to challenge the β€zehn ki lootβ€™, to speak truth to power, on this occasion stand up for our fellow activists. Because the channels in question do enjoy immense power β€“ power to distort, to misrepresent, to establish and reinforce a β€common senseβ€™ that is entirely at odds with reality. Also, the problem is a larger one. As a womenβ€™s rights activist, for instance, I have gone on shows I know to be hostile to my ideas, to be able to say β€not in my nameβ€™ to shrill cries for the death penalty. In 2013 when the rape law amendments were being battled over, all channels and print media almost without exception achieved a spectacular β€zehn ki lootβ€™ β€“ they all conducted debates on the supposed β€loweringβ€™ of the age of consent, effectively erasing the truth in the public mind β€“ which was that the age of consent was being raised, thereby criminalising consensual sexual relations among teenagers! To try to talk sense on those shows was exhausting, and one was struck more than once by a sense of futility and defeat, as the media successfully turned fiction into fact. On more than one channel, I have been subjected to sexist abuse by a fellow panelist, with no reaction from the anchor. Even if activists decide in future to steer clear of those shows that do not even allow one to voice oneβ€™s opinions, some questions will remain. TV channels are not the private homes of anchors. Channels do have a public role and an accountability to the public. How to hold them to it? How to prevent them from getting away with the abuse of their power? How can we hold media power accountable? Even the fairly tame and modest National Broadcasting Authority norms lay down the following principles for electronic media (I quote the relevant norms in contrast with what takes place on News Hour and many other channels too): Β β€News shall not be selected or designed to promote any particular belief, opinion or desires of any interest group.β€ Can a TV news show then, design its show to promote the opinions of a Government affidavit β€“ as that 17th February News Hour show did? Β β€Broadcasters shall ensure a full and fair presentation of news as the same is the fundamental responsibility of each news channel. Realizing the importance of presenting all points of view in a democracy, the broadcasters should, therefore, take responsibility in ensuring that controversial subjects are fairly presented, with time being allotted fairly to each point of viewβ€¦.β€ andβ€¦ β€TV News channels must provide for neutrality by offering equality for all affected parties, players and actors in any dispute or conflict to present their point of view. Though neutrality does not always come down to giving equal space to all sides (news channels shall strive to give main view points of the main parties) news channels must strive to ensure that allegations are not portrayed as fact and charges are not conveyed as an act of guilt.β€ When an anchor chooses to shout down all opinions but the ones he agrees with, when he heckles dissenting/differing voices rather than moderator of a fair debate, when he mutes the mikes of guests whose arguments he doesnβ€™t agree with, when he allows only those he agrees with to make their point uninterrupted, is it in keeping with the obligation to allot time fairly and allow all sides to be heard? When the anchor and his tag-team of frothing-at-the-mouth men repeatedly brand activists as β€anti-nationalβ€™, is he not presenting allegations as facts and charges as an act of guilt? When channels and newspapers brand terror accused as β€terroristsβ€™, or rape-accused as β€rapistsβ€™ and orchestrate the chant for the death penalty for them; when they act as stenos or loudspeakers for the police or investigative agencies in terror cases; are they not doing grievous harm and endangering peopleβ€™s lives and safety? Are they not conveying allegations as guilt? The NBA code of ethics also enjoins channels to β€β€¦ avoidβ€¦ broadcasting content that is m

Comments By: Express News Service | Ahmedabad | Published:December 6, 2014 3:32 am The Gujarat High Court on Friday directed Mumbai-based activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and three others to appear before the Ahmedabad Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) every fortnight in the alleged Gulberg Society fund misuse case. The move came during the hearing on anticipatory bail application moved by Setalvad and others before the bench of justice A J Desai. Setalvadβ€™s lawyer sought adjournment when senior lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani, who appeared for state government as special public prosecutor, argued that the accused are not cooperating with the investigation and they should appear before the investigating officer. Setalvad and others have sought anticipatory bail from the HC after their similar application was rejected by a sessions court in March this year. January this year, the DCB lodged an FIR against Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ahsan Jafri, Salim Sandhi and Feroz Gulzar Pathan, chairman and secretary of Gulberg Society, respectively. The FIR had been lodged by Feroz Saeekhan Pathan, a former resident of the society where 69 persons were burnt alive during the riots in 2002. Pathan alleged in the complaint that Setalvad and others grabbed pictures and video footage of the society as well as other riot-affected areas and uploaded it on the websites of Citizens for Justice & Peace & Sabrang Trust to collect funds. The money was supposed to be utilised in construction of a museum at the Gulberg Society in memory of the riot victims. But the project couldnβ€™t take off while the funds collected by them was allegedly used by the accused for their personal purposes.

"New Delhi:Β  As a court in Mumbai gets ready to hear activist Teesta Setalvad's petition seeking protection from arrest, questions remain over whether the CBI's charges against her are grounded in facts. Β  The basic charge, on the basis of which the CBI has registered an FIR or police complaint, is that her organisation Sabrang Communication had received Rs 1.5 crore from the Ford Foundation without legal clearance. Β  But the CBI's FIR, accessed by NDTV, accuses Ms Setalvad's organisation of not just violating foreign exchange laws, but also threatening national security. Β  It says Sabrang's activities constitute an 'interference towards the internal security of India'' and \prejudicially affect(ing).. harmony between communities\"" Β  At the same time, the FIR appears to contradict itself, saying the organisation's activities were to: \""Organise public meetings for peace\"", \""Educate lawyers on misuse of criminal law\"", \""create strong civil society voices... to engender peace\"" and \""media advocacy on sensitive reporting on communities\"". Β  It is unclear how such activities could be construed as a threat to national security or as an attempt to spark communal tension. In reply to queries from NDTV, the CBI said that these are allegations which have to be proved. It said the content of the FIR was based on the complaint it received from the Home Ministry. The CBI spokesperson said the \""The MHA had conducted a detailed enquiry, which formed the basis of the complaint. CBI is legally bound to investigate all aspects of the case. The submissions of the accused persons will be looked into during the investigation, as per due process of law.\"" Β  The CBI, in its application arguing against the grant of bail to Ms Setalvad, expands on the same theme, saying that her organisation is involved in a \""deep seated conspiracy\"" for which the agency needs to carry out \""sustained custodial interrogation\"" in 'isolation\"". Β  The activist's lawyers have pointed out that such demands are normally made in cases where the charges are of terrorism, not financial impropriety. Β  Several human rights groups, political parties and lawyers have criticised the government for its heavy-handed action against Ms Setalvad, which they say suggests the setting of political scores. The activist has been involved for years in fighting the cases of the victims of the 2002 riots in Gujarat.

"By Preetha Nair, New Delhi, 21 July 2015: Amid all the legal troubles she and her husband Javed Anand face, human rights activist Teesta Setalvad is unfazed and believes that the good will finally triumph. Accusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of political vendetta, Setalvad took strong exception to the CBI calling her a \national threat\"". In an interview to IANS, Setalvad said this echoed the mindset of the Narendra Modi government. β€It is ludicrous and disgusting and echoes the mindset of the regime in Delhi. We are a threat only to those who believe in the politics of hatred and division,β€ she said. The CBI had registered a case against Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on July 8. The agency claimed that her firm, Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd, received around Rs.1.8 crore in donations from overseas. Countering allegations of taking money from Ford Foundation, Setalvad said she had cooperated with the investigation, giving 25,000 pages of documentary evidence. \""Communalism Combat\"", the monthly magazine published by Sabrang Communications, signed an agreement with Ford Foundation in 2004 and 2006 after eminent legal counsel said this would not violate FCRA. Sabrang kept records and provided copies of the document during an inspection by FCRA in Mumbai on June 9-10. Additional documents were also posted. With the Zakia Jafri case scheduled to come up in the Gujarat High Court on July 27, Setalvad sees a political conspiracy in the CBI probe and the raid that took place at her office. The petition filed by Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed by a mob in Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Society in 2002, denounces a court-appointed Special Investigation Teamβ€™s closure report. The report ruled out the prosecution of Narendra Modi -- who was Gujarat's chief minister during the 2002 riots -- for his alleged role in the violence. Setalvad felt that the cases against her was an effort to deny legal and constitutional rights to the survivors of the 2002 riots. β€Last year, the Gujarat Crime Branch lodged a false FIR on 'embezzlement' on me after a magistrate rejected the protest petition of Zakia Jafri. The attempt was clearly to obstruct the filing of an appeal. \""Despite all odds, our team filed the criminal revision. Now, when the matter is going to be heard, the CBI is being unleashed on us to prevent assistance to senior lawyers who will argue in the Gujarat High Court,β€ she said. Raising doubts about the role of some officers in the agency, she alleged that there was a concerted attempt to intimidate, harass and vilify her in the public domain. She says this includes Ahmedabad police commissioner, Shivananad Jha, who was being held culpable -- in Jafri's petition -- for gross acts of commission on the night of February 27, 2002. Ditto for A.K. Sharma, a former joint commissioner of police in Ahmedabad who she said \""was at the forefront of lodging the FIR against us in January 2014, and now he is the joint director CBI in Delhiβ€. Setalvad said she faces six \""politically motivated FIRs\"" and several other cases meant to malign her - all on the proposed memorial at the Gulberg Society. β€The original complaint by some Gulberg victims was of Rs.4.6 lakhs collected for a dream project, the Gulberg Memorial. It had to be dropped because of steep rise in land prices. (The money) is still lying unutilised in the accounts. This entire chain of vindictive actions began and is aggressively pressed by the Ahmedabad police,β€ she said. Dismissing allegations that she has been targeting Narendra Modi, Setalvad said her allegations were based on evidences, collated from the affidavits of serving police officers, from the National Human Rights Commission, and the report and evidence before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, Crimes Against Humanity, 2002. Setalvad said he affirms her faith in the triumph of justice. β€In the 13 years since the Gujarat violence, we fought 68 cases. It has resulted in 120 convictions up to life imprisonment and had created path-breaking jurisprudence empowering the rights of citizens and survivors.β€ (Preetha Nair can be contacted at preetha.n@ians.in) -"""

Ever since the β€one million suitβ€™ donned by PM Modi during Obamaβ€™s Delhi visit early in January this year hogged the front page of the newspapers, the NDA led regime at centre as well as in various states has been caught up in the cobwebs of unending controversies and scandals. Far from being allayed the allegations have of late continued to heap with each passing day. The highly pitched slogans like β€Gharibon ki sarkarβ€™ and β€Sabka saath sabka vikasβ€™ have all proven to be just an eyewash. Amit Shahβ€™s recent Freudian slip that it will take 25 years for the promised β€Ache Dinβ€™ to arrive was to exhibit the real state of affairs behind the curtains of rhetoric and sham promises. On face of it the controversy around Lalit Modi, Simriti Iraniβ€™s fake degree issue, failure to retrieve black money stashed in overseas banks, a new turn in Vyapam Scam, FTII row and CBI raids on social activist Teesta Setalvad at a time just ahead of July 27 when the final hearing of the revision application filed by Zakia Jafri against the lower courtβ€™s clean chit to PM Modi and 58 others in 2002 riots is set to begin at Gujarat High Court has further brought the NDA in a doghouse. On the other hand the fanatic forces, being given a free reign, are generously chipping in their bit. A recently released study has ranked India 24th amongst 35 nations in the comparison on protection of fundamental rights. Β  A thorough analysis of the policies and steps undertaken by the government over last one year clearly exude the corporate and elite class interests. Even the Budget for 2015-16 fiscal witnessed some overbearing commercial tendencies. It is no wonder then that the tax exemptions to corporate world amounted to a whopping 500,000 crore. At the same time deliberate and dramatic reduction in public investments in social sectors like education and health, enfeebling the labour protections and the controversial land acquisition bill promulgated by the BJP inform the first innings of the NDA led government. Although FII inflows have surged a record 717% to $ 40.92 billion dollar and FDI inflows have jumped 48% since September 2014, the benefit is yet to percolate down into the major part of India which lives in its villages and urban slums. Starvation continues to haunt mankind while proper education, healthcare, sanitation and basic utilities continue to remain elusive for a major chunk of population. The gulf between rich and poor is widening with time leading to inequality assuming new heights. The tyranny is that the barometer of development is showing the skewed results. It is true that India as a nation is growing richer but it is equally true that majority of its people are becoming poorer. At a time when the Nation needs funds for an inclusive social and economic development, the government continues to hang on to irrelevant and unyielding proposals like US-India nuclear dealβ€”merely for enhancing its bargaining power in international arena and for induction into cartels like Nuclear Suppliers Group, Missile Technology Control Regime etcβ€”which has no prospectus other than bringing misery in the long run to the Indian people in general and tax payers in particular.Β  As such a question mark hangs on the future strategy and course of action of NDA led regime. Is India going to witness a balanced and equitable development engrossing all rank and file or is development continuously going to be judged by the wealth and prosperity of its economic elite? The question begs for an answer. Β  Β  Β Tail piece: At a time when farmers are committing suicides out of despair, celebrities like Amitabh Bachan are being roped in for campaigning on Doordarshanβ€™s Kisan Channel by paying them crores of rupees. At a time when having a square meal per day remains a farfetched dream for millions, cancellation of one visit of 4 hours and 35 minutes duration by PM Modi costs 17 crore to the state exchequer.

"New Delhi: The Gujarat government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking cancellation of interim bail to social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand.

On February 19, the apex court restrained Gujarat Police from arresting activist Setalvad and her husband in connection with the alleged misuse of Sabrang Trust funds. The restrain order was extended on March 19 when the apex court referred to a larger bench the question if the personal liberty and requirement of effective investigation, including custodial interrogation, leave scope for an anticipatory bail. Seeking cancellation of the interim bail granted to Setalvad and Anand, the Gujarat government has contended that Setalvad and Anand needed to be subjected to custodial interrogation as their responses to queries by the state police were \stock and evasive\"". The affidavit, filed by Gujarat cyber crime cell's Assistant Commissioner of Police K.N.Patel, says there are several areas where investigation into the alleged misuse of funds collected in the name of riot victims and to set up a museum needs to be carried out. Seeking rejection of the couple's anticipatory bail application, Gujarat Police said \""investigating agency be permitted the discretion to arrest them and take them into custody for interrogation so that full extent of petitioner's crimes against charity could be unearthed and a comprehensive chargesheet filed.\"" Gujarat Police have alleged that their investigation points to \""perpetration of colossal fraud\"" by Setalvad and her husband Anand \""aided and abetted\"" by others to collect funds to the tune of Rs.6 to 7 crore in the \""name of riot victims by a massive fund collection drive from 2007-2014 through advertisements in the magazine\"" owned by them and also through the \""conduct of musical and artistic events\"".

Setalvad has been accused of misuse of funds collected by Sabrang Trust for setting up a museum in Gulberg Society that witnessed carnage during 2002 Gujarat riots. Ferozkhan Saeedkhan Pathan filed a complaint with Gujarat Police alleging that Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, managed by trustees Setalvad and her husband, collected funds to set up a museum at Gulberg Society.

"AHMEDABAD:Β The Gujarat High Court granted a stay on any legal action against rights activist Teesta Setalwad here today, in a case related to posting allegedly objectionable pictures of Hindu gods and goddesses on Twitter. Social activist Teesta Setalvad (PTI File Photo) Justice J B Pardiwala of the Gujarat High Court granted the stay in connection with an FIR filed in Bhavnagar city until further hearing on December 3 and also served a notice to the complainant through the investigating officer of the Gujarat police. Setalwad had sought for quashing of the FIR lodged in Bhavnagar city saying there were two FIRs lodged for the same offence in Bhavnagar and in Ahmedabad city, which is contrary to legal provisions. \There cannot be two FIRs against the same person for the same offence, while in this case, two separate FIRs were lodged by the Gujarat police at two different police stations,\"" Advocate Y N Rawani told the Gujarat High Court. An FIR was lodged against Setalwad by a social worker Kirit Mistry in 'C' division police station in Bhavnagar city on August 23 accusing her of displaying objectionable pictures of Hindu gods and goddesses. Setalwad was charged with promoting enmity between two religious groups and committing deliberate malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs under Sections 153(A) and 205(A) of the IPC.

"By Preetha Nair New Delhi : Amid all the legal troubles she and her husband Javed Anand face, human rights activist Teesta Setalvad is unfazed and believes that the good will finally triumph. Accusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of political vendetta, Setalvad took strong exception to the CBI calling her a \national threat\"". In an interview to IANS, Setalvad said this echoed the mindset of the Narendra Modi government. β€It is ludicrous and disgusting and echoes the mindset of the regime in Delhi. We are a threat only to those who believe in the politics of hatred and division,β€ she said. The CBI had registered a case against Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on July 8. The agency claimed that her firm, Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd, received around Rs.1.8 crore in donations from overseas. Countering allegations of taking money from Ford Foundation, Setalvad said she had cooperated with the investigation, giving 25,000 pages of documentary evidence. \""Communalism Combat\"", the monthly magazine published by Sabrang Communications, signed an agreement with Ford Foundation in 2004 and 2006 after eminent legal counsel said this would not violate FCRA. Sabrang kept records and provided copies of the document during an inspection by FCRA in Mumbai on June 9-10. Additional documents were also posted. With the Zakia Jafri case scheduled to come up in the Gujarat High Court on July 27, Setalvad sees a political conspiracy in the CBI probe and the raid that took place at her office. The petition filed by Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed by a mob in Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Society in 2002, denounces a court-appointed Special Investigation Teamβ€™s closure report. The report ruled out the prosecution of Narendra Modi -- who was Gujarat's chief minister during the 2002 riots -- for his alleged role in the violence. Setalvad felt that the cases against her was an effort to deny legal and constitutional rights to the survivors of the 2002 riots. β€Last year, the Gujarat Crime Branch lodged a false FIR on 'embezzlement' on me after a magistrate rejected the protest petition of Zakia Jafri. The attempt was clearly to obstruct the filing of an appeal. \""Despite all odds, our team filed the criminal revision. Now, when the matter is going to be heard, the CBI is being unleashed on us to prevent assistance to senior lawyers who will argue in the Gujarat High Court,β€ she said. Raising doubts about the role of some officers in the agency, she alleged that there was a concerted attempt to intimidate, harass and vilify her in the public domain. She says this includes Ahmedabad police commissioner, Shivananad Jha, who was being held culpable -- in Jafri's petition -- for gross acts of commission on the night of February 27, 2002. Ditto for A.K. Sharma, a former joint commissioner of police in Ahmedabad who she said \""was at the forefront of lodging the FIR against us in January 2014, and now he is the joint director CBI in Delhiβ€. Setalvad said she faces six \""politically motivated FIRs\"" and several other cases meant to malign her - all on the proposed memorial at the Gulberg Society. β€The original complaint by some Gulberg victims was of Rs.4.6 lakhs collected for a dream project, the Gulberg Memorial. It had to be dropped because of steep rise in land prices. (The money) is still lying unutilised in the accounts. This entire chain of vindictive actions began and is aggressively pressed by the Ahmedabad police,β€ she said. Dismissing allegations that she has been targeting Narendra Modi, Setalvad said her allegations were based on evidences, collated from the affidavits of serving police officers, from the National Human Rights Commission, and the report and evidence before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, Crimes Against Humanity, 2002. Setalvad said he affirms her faith in the triumph of justice. β€In the 13 years since the Gujarat violence, we fought 68 cases. It has resulted in 120 convictions up to life imprisonment and had created path-breaking jurisprudence empowering the rights of citizens and survivors.β€ India News Indian Muslim Top Story"""
"New Delhi, 22 July 2015: The Gujarat government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking cancellation of interim bail to social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand.

Gujarat Police has told the Supreme Court that social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand had used 2002 riot victims as β€poster boysβ€ to raise Rs. 6-7 crore. The Police also informed the court that Teesta and her husband indulged in a colossal fraud, using most of the money for their personal expenses. Teesta and her husband are the trustees of the two NGOs, Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice. Using the NGOβ€™s as a shield the two misappropriated the funds for consumption of liquor, wines and dining at expensive restaurants, purchase of personal items and even on an expensive hairdo at Rome and in Pakistan. The Police also clarified that Teesta claimed Rs. 5000 as reimbursements for the Rome-hairdo and another Rs. 3800 for the Pakistan-hairdo. The expenses were put under the β€secular education or legal aid expensesβ€ head. β€In spite of using the Gulbarg Society and its membersβ€™ plight as poster boys for the collection of funds, no financial support was ever disbursed, no rent was reimbursed and absolutely no funds were received for rehabilitation of the affected persons. No steps were taken for the reconstruction of the houses of the inhabitants of Gulbarg society, nor the society was converted into museum,β€ the Gujarat cops said as they opposed the anticipatory bail granted by the Supreme Court to Teesta and her husband. Police also informed that only a tiny portion of the big amount raised for the welfare of the riot victims and for construction of the β€Gulbarg Society Museum of Resistanceβ€ was spent for the stated purpose, the rest was spent by Teesta and her husband for personal expenses. The affidavit also alleges that Teesta and Javed, who have no source of income, have been dependent on the funds raised for the riot victims for their β€livelihoodβ€. β€Having raised funds in the name of riot victims during the said period amounting to between Rs 6-7 crore, the petitioners by diverse means, both audaciously and by blatant and subtle camouflage, dishonestly misappropriated or converted to their own use funds meant for the riot victims and other charitable purposes,β€ police said. The affidavit said Teesta drew an annual salary ranging from Rs 179400 in 2008 to Rs 875800 in 2013 and similarly remuneration drawn by her husband increased at a compounded annual rate of 53% from Rs 240000 in 2008 to Rs 861000 in 2013. β€It is to be noted that 45% of the total funds received in 2008-13 by the Sabrang Trust have found their way to the petitioners either directly or through Sabrang Communication Pvt Limited (SCPPL) which was fully owned by them,β€ the affidavit said. Comments
The impression that the executive is trying to encroach upon the judiciary's territory, created with the replacement of the collegium system of appointing judges with a government-dominated commission, may gain ground with the Prime Minister's thoughtless remarks made at the Chief Justices' conference on Sunday. He said β€five-star activistsβ€ were driving courts, which implies court orders/verdicts get influenced by high-profile petitioners. He said judges are led more by perception than facts. It is possible Modi had in mind the case of activist Teesta Setalvad, whose possible arrest in an embezzlement case was stayed by the apex court. Two of the judges hearing her bail plea were replaced on the allegation that they had invited the PM to the weddings of their children. Then the Delhi High Court had questioned the government for stopping environmentalist Priya Pillai from going to London for deposition before select British parliamentarians. Another provocative remark Modi made was that the β€judiciary is not as fearless as it used to be 10 years backβ€. Chief Justice H.L. Dattu contested this, saying β€judges are as fearless as they ever wereβ€. This reminds one of the recent Supreme Court judgments in the cancellation of spectrum and coal allocations as well as the squashing of Section 66A of the IT Act, which were not to the liking of the executive. Yet annother objectionable point he made was that politicians were under β€24-hour scrutinyβ€. β€If we do some mistakes, we are skinned aliveβ€ but β€the need was to strengthen all the institutions of democracyβ€. The regulatory system in the judiciary, he suggested, was lax. Judges, it is true, are not infallible. The conduct of some of them has not been above reproach. The acceptance of a gubernatorial post by a recently retired Chief Justice had raised eyebrows. But Modiβ€™s insinuations were avoidable, especially when the Supreme Court is hearing petitions challenging the National Judicial Appointments Commission. Despite all the shortcomings and inadequacies of judges and courts, the common people still trust the judiciary more than any other arm of democracy and may not share the PM's perception about the judiciary.Β

"By TwoCircles.net Staff Reporter, Banaras: At a time when embattled human rights activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand are facing ferocious government crackdown, several Mufti, Ulama and intellectuals from Banaras have come out in her support. As many as 12 such community and religious leaders have extended support to Setalvad terming her harassment at the hands of government as undemocratic and said, all Indians having faith in democracy are with her and Anand during their hardship. Modi government is relentlessly harassing and intimidating Setalvad, Anand and their colleagues alleging violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) by their Non Governmental Organizations, these leaders claimed. Setalvad and Anand represent three organisations β€”Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), Sabrang Communications and Sabrang Trustβ€” and all these have been in the forefront of the fight against communal forces. CJPβ€™s assistance to survivors of the communal carnage in Gujarat in 2002 has been principally responsible for the conviction of around 120 persons who participated in the violent attacks on Muslims. The Bilkees Lateef case, the Best Bakery case and the notorious Naroda Patiya case stand out as instances of the effectiveness of civil society intervention. CJP helped the survivors, protected witnesses, and paid lawyers to represent them, the main reason seen behind some semblance of justice that is delivered in Gujarat riot cases. Last year, CJP and Sabrang have faced numerous inquiries from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) into their accounts ending with a first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on July 8, 2015. Recently there was a raid on Setalvadβ€™s residence and offices on July 14. The present support shown by Muslim scholarsβ€™ group from Varanasi is an extension of pouring in of support by many other human and civil rights activists that have been continuously condemning Setalvadβ€™s hounding by Modi government and are demonstrating against her harassment. This group has alleged that the central government is trying to strangulate the voices against it in an undemocratic manner and that the persecution of Setalvad is apparently due to her fight in bringing justice to 2002 Gujarat pogrom victims. Issuing a statement on behalf of Muslim masses living in Varanasi, the group said that considering the hardship Setalvad is going through, \there is no doubt that many more, who are against the government, will meet the same fate.\"" Following Mufti, Ulama and intellectuals issued the support for Setalvad and Anand: 1.

"The Bombay High Court has extended interim protection from arrest to social activist Teesta Setalvad for two weeks.Β  A special CBI court on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail application of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband filed in connection with a case registered by CBI alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. \The anticipatory bail application is rejected,\"" said Special judge Anis Khan while turning down the plea.Β Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand had moved the court for bail on July 17. Immediately after the order, Setalvad told the court that she was shocked.Β \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic).\"" The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Setalvad and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).Β According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the court that they were innocent and were falsely implicated.Β Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them is to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI in their reply, last Friday, had said that motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India.Β \""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation.

The CBI had also told the court that when their premises were searched on July 14 this year there was total resistance and non-cooperation from their side. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation and SCPPL were seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants.

The case is that Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) run by Teesta and her husband were running Communalism Combat a magazine which they co-edited and published with foreign funding. The new law prohibits receipt of foreign funding by editors, columnist, correspondents, printers or publishers of a paper. The Home Ministry's case is that of an alleged fund of over Rs 1.15 crore received between 2009 and 2013, most of it was spent on legal aid, not \""educational and economic\"" purpose which the funds were received for. Teesta's case is that the allegations, raid and the case is trumped up and a clear attention to \""intimidate and harass\"". She said she had broken no law. \""No laws have been broken by us. This is a continuation of the persecution and witch hunt first launched by the Gujarat police in 2014 then under the dispensation that rules Delhi.

"In a breather to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband, the Bombay High Court today granted the duo 17-day interim relief from arrest in a CBI case alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting Teesta and her husband Javed Anand interim protection from arrest till August 10, said the duo was already given protection by the sessions court. Teesta and Anand moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail after a special CBI court today rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas and also refused to extend the interim relief granted to them earlier on July 17. \At this stage I do not want to go into merits. Is there any chance of the accused persons absconding? If no, then interim protection can be granted for a period of two weeks,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. The court directed Teesta and her husband to appear before the office of Economic Offences Wing of CBI on July 27 and 30 and on August 3 and 6 for recording their statement from 12pm to 3pm. The court refused to agree to the CBI's demand to direct the duo to appear before the agency everyday. \""They (Teesta and Javed) have been appearing before you (CBI) from July 17. You must have done some investigation. Everyday appearance is not required,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. Public Prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, appearing for CBI, argued that the offence was of a serious nature and custodial interrogation was required. The court has posted their anticipatory bail petitions for final hearing on August 10. Soon after the sessions court rejected her bail pleas, Teesta told the court that she was shocked and aggrieved. \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic),\"" she said. The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). According to the agency, SCPPL was not registeredΒ under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the special CBI court that they were innocent and were falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them was to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI in their reply, last Friday, had said that the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India. \""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation. Setalvad alleged that the FIR registered against her and her husband was for the purpose of harassing and torturing them, a charge rejected by CBI. \""The applicants are deliberately mixing up the offences alleged against them with non-related issues in order to divert the attention from the serious charges against them,\"" the agency had said. The CBI had also told the court that when their premises were searched on July 14 this year there was total resistance and non-cooperation from their side. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation and SCPPL were seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants.

"New Delhi:Β  Facing closure notice, activist Teesta Setalvad's two NGOs - Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust - have conveyed to the Home Ministry that they have done no financial irregularities and no foreign contribution was misused by any of its office bearer. The reply came in response to the notices served by the Home Ministry asking the NGOs why their registration under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act would not be cancelled as on-site inspection of records and books of accounts of the two found \irregularities and financial misappropriation\"". Sabrang Trust said its primary activities include school education, information documentation and dissemination and advocacy. The primary focus of Sabrang is on celebration, promotion of constitutional values (diversity, pluralism, communal amity, rule of law, impartial policing, accountability of state actors) and combating religious intolerance, hate propaganda, communal violence, terrorism, it said. This project was funded by Ford Foundation between October 2009 and March 2013. Between 2003 and 2014, Teesta Setalvad received an average of Rs 39,000 per month as honorarium for execution of specific projects of Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust funded by different donor agencies, it said. During the same period, Ms Setalvad's husband Javed Anand got an average of Rs 23,500 per month as salary for execution of specific projects of the two NGOs funded by different donor agencies. The auditors have found no financial discrepancy in the records of Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, the NGO claimed. Citizens For Justice and Peace, which primarily works for providing legal aid to victims of \""mass crimes (communalism, terrorism),\"" too denied the allegations of embezzlement of funds by Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand. Since its inception till date, over 70 per cent of the funds received by CJP (including foreign donations) have been raised by the trustees through personal contributions, donations from their family and friends and art auction, it claimed.

By Muslim Mirror News, Mumbai:Β  Trustees of Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust have strongly rebutted Gujarat Policeβ€™s claims which were mentioned in the latest Affidavit given to the Supreme Court describing it as a bundle of lies. They said the aims and objectives of both CJP and Sabrang Trust as contained in their founding documents are wide enough to allow for a wide range of activities.Β  However, since its inception in 2002, CJPβ€™s core concern has been to provide legal aid to the victims of mass crimes. Sabrang Trustβ€™s main focus has been, one, Khoj (education for a plural India) programme run in schools, and two, conflict resolution and peace building. β€In certain emergency situations, both Trusts have engaged in relief and rehabilitation efforts but that never was, or claimed by us to be, their main purposeβ€. Giving rebuttal point by point, trustees Anil Dharker, Nandan Maluste, Alyque Padamsee, I.M. Kadri, Cyrus Guzder, Anil Dharker, Ghulam Pesh Imam, Cedric Prakash, Shakuntala Kulkarni, Javed Anand, Teesta Setalvad (Secretary) and Sabrang Trust β€“ Trustees Ravi Kulkarni, Nakul Mehta, Amili Setalvad, Javed Anand, Teesta SetalvadΒ  Β said: Β  Β  1. What the Trusts Raised Funds For. As the Survivors of the carnage in Gulberg Society were unable to sell their individual properties at a fair price, it was collectively decided to try and raise funds to build a memorial at Gulberg Society. Since we, Sabrang Trust (CJP never had anything to do with the Memorial) only managed to raise Rs 4.6 lakhs, we had to inform the Society (members) that the Memorial project was not feasible. No contract was ever signed, no property or deed ever changed hands, no rent was promised nor monies changed hands. The Rs 4.6 lakhs donated by individuals (all Indians, including one NRI) is still unutilised Β  Β 2. On Funds Raised and Activities Conducted for Legal Aid. CJP raised money for providing legal aid to Victims and its record in this respect is unprecedented in India. Witness protection and probity during trial despite hostile regimes have ensured the convictions of 120 persons. It is these gains that the regime in power in Delhi wants to snatch away. In each of these cases, CJP argued against the death penalty as our commitment to lasting human rights jurisprudence.Β  An amendment in the CRPC in 2009 was a recognition of these efforts (Section 24(8)(2)) whereby victims have for the first time been given statutory rights of legal presence during trial. It was and is CJPβ€™s perseverance that has rendered meaning to the Supreme Courtβ€™s monitoring of key trials. Each time there was a breach, it was our legal team that brought serious lapses to the notice of the Supreme Court. Sabrang Trust raised money for its Khoj programme in schools and for conflict resolution and peace building. On Salaries to Teesta and Javed. All payments to Teesta or Javed were strictly in accordance with the budgets proposed to and accepted by Ford Foundation, UNVFVT, CRY, etc. Over a period of 10 years (2004-2014), the monthly payments from all projects put together was Rs 39,000 per month for Teesta and Rs 23,500 per month for Javed. Β  4. On Siphoning Trust Monies to Sabrang Communications (page 16 of the Affidavit). Alleged siphoning through Sabrang Communications: On requests from Sabrang Trust and CJP, Sabrang Communications (the oldest entity, a private limited company founded in 1993) agreed to share its office space, office equipment and staff on an expenses sharing basis. No rent was ever paid by ST or CJP to Sabrang Communications. The premises, which are owned by Teestaβ€™s parents, were given rent-free to SC. All payments by CJP and ST towards reimbursements for shared expenses were as per resolutions passed from time to time by their respective trustees. Teesta and Javed recused themselves from the decisions taken in all such instances. SC made no profit from this expenses sharing arrangement and Teesta and Javed were not paid even a rupee out of such reimbursements. Allegation that We Canβ€™t Buy What We Want from the Remunerations Received by Us (page 19 of the affidavit). This allegation is too ridiculous to merit comment. Funds Raised through Art Auction by Sabrang Trust (page 21 of the Affidavit). The funds raised through the Art Auction were intended to support the core activities that have been spelt out at the very beginning. It was never claimed by the Trusts that the funds so raised were for financial help for Victims. Indiaβ€™s leading artists gave generously of their works to support these endeavours due to the high regard for our work. No Accounts for Legal Aid work by CJP (page 24 of the Affidavit). Everyone in India and abroad, except for the Gujarat police, recognises the legal aid work undertaken by CJP, and its outcome.Β  It is evident from the annual audited accounts of CJP submitted to the authorities (Income Tax, Charity Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs-FCRA) that 80-90 per cent of CJP s annual expenses are incurred on legal aid (including expenses on CJPβ€™s field office in Gujarat) to coordinate the legal work. Since its inception, CJP has fought 68 legal cases from trial court to Supreme Court β€“ a historic endeavour. Allegations on Funds Raised for Ambulances (page 26 of Affidavit). Donations to CJP were meant not only for purchase but the operating costs over the years (running) of two Ambulances. The unspent amount of the funds earmarked for Ambulances at the end of each year is in the balance sheet of CJP. Β  Β  9. Funds Raised through Art Exhibition (page 27 of the Affidavit). Funds raised through the Art Exhibition were for the core activity of CJP which is legal aid.Β  Top artists contributed generously of their work to support the cause of justice for the Survivors of mass crimes.

A Mumbai Sessions Court rejected an anticipatory bail application filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad. She is facing a case in connection with alleged foreign fund received by her NGO in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Setalvad who spearheaded a campaign for the 2002 Gujarat riot victims moved the Bombay High Court soon after the sessions court decision. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against Teesta and her husband Javed Annad on July 8 and raided their home and offices a week later. CBI is investigating whether Teestaβ€™s NGO Sabrang received funding from the US-based Ford Foundation without prior approval from the Government as per the rules. The Gujarat Police recently filed an affidavit before the court that informed about Teesta and Javedβ€™s misappropriation of funds, meant for charity, for their personal luxury ranging from wine, expensive hairdo and a posh life. The Police also accused Teesta of tampering with the evidence. The CBI registered the case and begun the investigation about the funding after receiving a directive in this regard from the Home Ministry. One of the Sabrang Societyβ€™s bank account in Mumbai was frozen on the instructions of the Home Ministry. CBI also confiscated certain documents from the firm which appears to support the allegations against Teesta. Comments
"Mumbai:Β  Activist Teesta Setalvad, who was fighting a case brought against her by the CBI, said today that she believes, \This is an attempt to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers that be.\"" After a Mumbai court refused anticipatory bail to Ms Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, they were granted interim bail by the Bombay High Court,Β  which means they cannot be arrested for at least another fortnight. The CBI is looking into whether Ms Setalvad's NGO received funding from the United States-based Ford Foundation without government permission. The 53-year-old says she is being persecuted for the cases that she filed earlier against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of failing to stop the communal riots that ravaged Gujarat in 2002. The Supreme Court has said there is no evidence that as Chief Minister at the time, Mr Modi did not do enough to stop the violence which killed at least 1,000 people. The CBI registered the case against Ms Setalvad on July 8 and raided their home and offices a week later. At an earlier hearing, the agency controversially described her as \""a threat to national security.\"" Β  Ms Setalvad has also been charged by the Gujarat police of embezzling funds donated to the non-profits she runs for victims of the Gujarat riots. Ms Setalvad has denied any wrongdoing in the multiple cases she confronts. The CBI says its investigation is based on a complaint from the Home Ministry and that the sum involved is over 1 crore rupees ($160,000). Amid a crackdown on foreign charities, the Home Ministry put the $12.5 billion Ford Foundation on a watch list this year. The PM has also criticised what he called \""five-star activists\"".

"New Delhi:Β Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan on Friday alleged that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre is hounding Teesta Setalvad for highlighting egregious things done by the Gujarat Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was then the state`s chief minister. \They are hounding her only because Teesta has highlighted some of the egregious things done by the Gujarat Government under Mr. Modi such as their involvement in the 2002 riots such as fakes encounters etc. Now, I am sure that she is moving the High Court against the order of the special judge and we hope and expect that the High Court will grant her anticipatory bail,\"" Bhushan told ANI here. Bhushan further considered her arrest against the Supreme Court`s guidelines, adding that one can`t be arrested in technical violation charges especially when the investigation is going on. \""It`s very shocking and surprising that the special judge has rejected Teesta`s anticipatory bail because the charges against her are some technical violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act(FCRA).Certainly, it`s not a case for arrest under the Supreme Court`s guidelines for arrest. You can`t arrest people during investigation on this kind of charge. The High Court had held the Congress and the BJP guilty of accepting crores of foreign donations and violations of the FCRA Act. The Central Government has not taken any action nor arrested anybody in those cases,\""he added.

"NO ARREST TILL AUGUST 10, RULES COURT Mumbai Mirror Bureau The Bombay High Court on Friday extended the interim relief granted to activist Teetsa Setalvad by a sessions court up to August 10, when the HC will hear the matter again. The CBI's Economic Offences Wing is investigating embezzlement charges against Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand. Earlier in the day, her anticipatory bail plea was rejected by a special CBI court. The HC, however, has asked Setalvad to present herself before the investigating agency on July 27, July 30, August 3 and August 6 between noon and 4 pm. At the hearing, Sandeep Shinde, appearing for the CBI, sought the continuation of the sessions court order on Setalvad presenting herself before the CBI every day between 3 pm and 5 pm. However, Justice Mridula Bhatkar took note of the fact that she has been doing so for almost a week and need not present herself every day. Instead, the number of days can be reduced by increasing the hours of her attendance. \There can't be an apprehension that she is likely to abscond, therefore the interim relief can be extended,\"" the court observed while granting relief. The case will now be heard on August 10. The special CBI court witnessed some drama as Setalvad and her husband's anticipatory bail was rejected on the ground that the complainant in the case was no \""ordinary\"" person, but the secretary of the Home Ministry. A clearly enraged Setalvad shot back saying it was a ploy to 'possibly eliminate' her. \""Being an individual, I am constrained to accept the order. My sympathisers feel it is done to intimidate me and possibly eliminate me. We have had other applications accepted in petty offences,\"" she responded. The court of special judge Anis Khan pointed out that she was in contempt of court by criticising the order, especially when she has a lawyer representing her. The judge noted that he accepts her apology for the same, but Setalvad and her lawyers replied saying they have not apologised as she had taken court's permission to address it. The CBI had registered a case against Setalvad and her husband on July 8, and raided their home and offices a week later.

"NEW DELHI: Anguished by the flippant charges made against her by the Gujarat police and other state agencies, activist Teesta Setalvad feels the entire purpose seemed to be to tarnish her character and divert attention from the substantive work she and her organization has done to bring relief and justice to the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. She sent TOI a point-by-point rebuttal of the Gujarat Police's claims that she and her husband Javed Anand misused money raised for Gujarat riot victims, through their organisations Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust. The state police, arguing against anticipatory bail for the couple, has claimed that they had raised Rs 6-7 crore for a Gulberg Society communal violence memorial. \In spite of using the Gulberg Society and its members' plight as poster boys for the collection of funds, no financial support was ever disbursed, no rent was reimbursed and absolutely no funds were received for rehabilitation of the affected persons. No steps were taken for the reconstruction of the houses of the inhabitants of Gulbarg society, nor the society was converted into museum,\"" it said. But Setalvad says the residents of the Gulberg Housing Society, who had left their homes after the massacre that killed 69 people in 2002, had been unable to sell at market price. In 2007-8, Sabrang Trust suggested fundraising to buy them and set up a memorial to the victims. By 2012, only Rs 4.6 lakh had been raised, the while a fair estimate of prices in 2007-8 amounted to Rs 3-4 crore. The office-bearers of Gulberg Society were duly informed by Sabrang, and asked to dispose of their property as they thought fit. The Rs 4.6 lakh collected for the memorial is lying untouched in the trust's bank account. The police affidavit also claimed that Setalvad drew an annual salary ranging from Rs 1,79,400 in 2008 to Rs 8,75,800 in 2013, while Anand's salary increased at a compounded annual rate of 53% from Rs 2,40,000 in 2008 to Rs 8,61,000 in 2013. It alleged that \""45% of the total funds received in 2008-13 by the Sabrang Trust have found their way to the petitioners either directly or through Sabrang Communication Pvt Limited (SCPPL) which was fully owned by them\"". Setalvad has broken down this amount to show that the contested amount, which she puts at 39.5%, was spent, according to audited accounts, on legitmate activities of the two organisations. She says that between 2003 and 2014, she received an average salary of Rs 39,000 per month, for executing specific projects of CJP and Sabrang Trust funded by various donor agencies. Javed Anand drew a salary of Rs. 23,500 a month in the same period. Auditing firm D.M Sathe & Co, after re-verifying the accounts of Sabrang Trust, reported to the crime branch that they found no financial irregularities or personal expenses charged to the trust. The CJP accounts had been audited by Haribhai & Co between 2003 and 13. They also reported to the crime branch that no irregularities had been found. She maintains that Citizens for Justice and Peace has provided documentary evidence of these claims, running into over 1,500 pages, to the Gujarat high court, and given the police over 11,000 pages of cash voucher payments made by the organisations. And yet, she says, the accounts of the two organisations have been frozen for the last 13 months on the basis of illegal instructions to the banks."""
"MUMBAI: In a reprieve for activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Bombay high court on Friday extended the interim protection from arrest to the couple till August 10. The HC relief came hours after a special CBI court rejected Setalvad's and Anand's plea for anticipatory bail and refused to extend their interim protection. Senior advocate Mihir Desai and advocate Vijay Hiremath rushed to the HC to challenge the order. Justice Mridula Bhatkar asked Setalvad and Anand to attend the CBI office for investigation purposes on four daysβ€”July 27 and 30, and August 3 and 6β€”between 12pm and 4pm. Public prosecutor Sandeep Shinde opposed the grant of interim anticipatory bail contending that the allegations were \serious in nature and involved the economic security of the country\"". He also drew the court's attention to the fact that the complainant was the Union government itself. Desai pointed out that the couple was on interim anticipatory bail and even their passports were deposited with the authorities. He added that the allegations were concerning interpretation of the law. The CBI had alleged the couple had violated the FCRA regulations for receiving $2,90,000 from Ford Foundation between 2004 and 2008, without prior permission from Centre. Setalvad's lawyers argued that no such permission was needed. Justice Bhatkar said the court would not go into the merits of the case as it was the first hearing. \""Is there an apprehension or chance that the accused will abscond,\"" Justice Bhatkar asked the prosecution, to which they remained silent. \""If no, then the interim protection can be extended since the sessions court had earlier granted the same.\"" The prosecution then insisted that the couple be directed to appear before the CBI every day for three hours. \""They have been appearing before you since July 17, and you must have done some investigations,\"" said the judge, who then directed the couple to appear before the CBI on four specific days. Earlier in the day, Setalvad and Anand were present before special judge AA Khan who pronounced the order that the anticipatory bail application had been rejected at 2.15pm. The judge said the probe was in progress and custody required in serious offence. After the verdict was pronounced, Setalvad addressed the judge. \""I am shocked and aggrieved. My sympathizers and I believe that it is done to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers in Delhi,\"" she said. This prompted the judge to state that this was a contempt of court, but he took no action against her. The couple's lawyers then filed an application seeking an interim stay. The application was heard after 3pm in the absence of Setalvad and Anand. Opposing the application, the CBI counsel argued that the absence was a contempt of court and there was no provision under the law to make such an application after the order on the anticipatory bail application had already been pronounced. While the judge rejected the couple's application for interim stay on the grounds that it was not maintainable under the law, he refused to accept the CBI's repeated request to mention their absence in the order."""
By IndiaTomorrow.net, Mumbai, 24 July 2015: Hours after a CBI court in Mumbai on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail of civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Bombay High Court granted them bail and asked police not to arrest them for two weeks. Β  They were apprehending arrest by the Economic Offences Wing of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on allegations of embezzlement. Β  Over rejection of bail plea, Setalvad reportedly told the CBI court that β€she was shocked and aggrieved by the judgement and she believes that it is done to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by powers in Delhi.β€ Β  The CBI on July 8 registered a case against Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a foreign funding case related to her NGO Sabrang NGO Sabrang Trust. Β 
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) seemed to have got what they wanted. A Mumbai court on Friday turned down the anticipatory bail plea of social activist, Teesta Setalvad, and her husband Javed Anand in a CBI probe into alleged violations of Foreign Contributions Regulatory Act (FCRA) in the running of her non-governmental organisation, the Sabrang Trust. However, within hours, the Bombay high court extended Setalvadβ€™s interim bail.Β  But, the conflict is far from over. The Union home ministry is reported to be considering derecognition of the Sabrang Trust because of violations of FCRA. The ministry, in its attempt to be seen as fair is reported to have decided that violations by another non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Setalvad, were not as serious as those committed by Sabrang Trust, and, therefore, the CJP will be kept under the β€prior permissionβ€™ list. This is based on the report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The central government had earlier asked the CBI to look into the possible violation of FCRA by the Sabrang Trust. Meanwhile, the Gujarat government opposed Setalvadβ€™s anticipatory bail petition, claiming that the money she had raised to help the 2002 riot victims was misspent on β€wine and luxuryβ€, and that Setalvad and her husband were not cooperating with the investigative agencies on the charges of embezzlement levelled against them. It is not a mere coincidence that the central government and the Gujarat government are probing the activities of Setalvad. It is not a routine probe. There is both a context and a motive for the government to move aggressively against her. For a decade now, Setalvad has been the most vocal voice against then Gujarat Chief Minister Modi after the 2002 communal riots in which nearly 2,000 Muslims were killed. Even, according to the official version, the figure for the dead is 1,000. Setalvad has fought this battle with great passion and courage.Β  The question here is not whether she is right in holding Modi and his then Gujarat government guilty of the violence against Muslims. It is the moral duty of a citizen to point out the wrongdoing of a government in good faith. In a democracy, governments are not a law unto themselves. It does not, however, justify that the Gujarat government or the Modi dispensation at the Centre retaliate against Setalvad even if they believe her view of the 2002 Gujarat riots to be flawed. It does not behove governments to retaliate against citizens who stand up against the State. It is indeed disturbing that the CBI should be specifically asked to look into the funding and expenditure of Sabrang Trust. It is the tax authorities who should have filed a case against the organisation if they had found discrepancies in the audited accounts. As a matter of fact, the chartered accountant firms which had audited the Sabrang Trust and the CJP certified the accounts as being in order. It is here that the motive of the government comes in for legitimate interrogation. First, the government had no reason to order a CBI inquiry into Setalvadβ€™s organisations. By asking the CBI to investigate the matter, the home ministry, in its arbitrary use of power, has clearly committed an act of high handedness.Β  The Gujarat governmentβ€™s arguments for opposing the anticipatory bail petition of Setalvad are clearly mala fide. One of the allegations levelled by the state government is of Setalvad misusing the money she raised from the public for Gulberg Society riot victims. This money, the government alleged, was spent on β€wine and luxuryβ€. Such absurd allegations reveal a clear streak of vindictiveness and meanness. They also expose the general and ill-conceived strategy of governments targeting their adversaries by framing all conceivable crimes within every potential section and clause of the penal law. It is based on the mindless belief that if one of the charges does not stick, the other surely will. By pursuing this course of political vendetta, governments not only fail in their duty to act as impartial arbiters of justice, they also damage their reputation in public perception. The State appears to be immoral, even if not strictly illegal.

By TCN News, Mumbai: On a day when Bombay High Court extended Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anandβ€™s interim bail by two weeks, barely hours after a special CBI court had rejected their anticipatory bail application, paving the way for their immediate arrest, Setalvadβ€™s NGO team has rebutted Gujarat policeβ€™s claim in their latest affidavit. Setalvad and Anand along with scores of others are involved in running of two NGOs β€“ Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust, which has Sabrang Communications and Publications. A case has been going on against the human right s activists and her team in connection with an allegation of misappropriating funds collected by her NGO to help victims of communal riots in Gujrat. The CJP trustees are: Anil Dharker, Nandan Maluste, Alyque Padamsee, I M Kadri, Cyrus Guzder, Ghulam Pesh Imam, Cedric Prakash, Shakuntala Kulkarni, Javed Anand, Teesta Setalvad (secretary) and Sabrang Trustβ€™s trustees are: Ravi Kulkarni, Nakul Mehta, Amili Setalvad, Javed Anand and Teesta Setalvad. CJP and Sabrang have come out with the following statement on Friday: To begin with, the aims and objectives of both CJP and Sabrang Trust as contained in their founding documents are wide enough to allow for a wide range of activities. However, since its inception in 2002, CJPβ€™s core concern has been to provide legal aid to the victims of mass crimes. Sabrang Trustβ€™s main focus has been, one, Khoj (education for a plural India) programme run in schools, and two, conflict resolution and peace building. In certain emergency situations, both Trusts have engaged in relief and rehabilitation efforts but that never was, or claimed by us to be, their main purpose. Thus the fund-raising efforts of both Trusts have been to support its core activities. 1. What the Trusts Raised Funds For. As the survivors of the carnage in Gulberg Society were unable to sell their individual properties at a fair price, it was collectively decided to try and raise funds to build a memorial at Gulberg Society. Since we, Sabrang Trust (CJP never had anything to do with the Memorial) only managed to raise Rs 4.6 lakhs, we had to inform the Society (members) that the Memorial project was not feasible. No contract was ever signed, no property or deed ever changed hands, no rent was promised nor monies changed hands. The Rs 4.6 lakhs donated by individuals (all Indians, including one NRI) is still unutilised. 2. On funds raised and activities conducted for legal aid. CJP raised money for providing legal aid to victims and its record in this respect is unprecedented in India. Witness protection and probity during trial despite hostile regimes have ensured the convictions of 120 persons. It is these gains that the regime in power in Delhi wants to snatch away. In each of these cases, CJP argued against the death penalty as our commitment to lasting human rights jurisprudence. An amendment in the CrPC in 2009 was a recognition of these efforts (Section 24(8) (2)) whereby victims have for the first time been given statutory rights of legal presence during trial. It was and is CJPβ€™s perseverance that has rendered meaning to the Supreme Courtβ€™s monitoring of key trials. Each time there was a breach, it was our legal team that brought serious lapses to the notice of the Supreme Court. Sabrang Trust raised money for its Khoj programme in schools and for conflict resolution and peace building. 3. On Salaries to Teesta and Javed. All payments to Teesta or Javed were strictly in accordance with the budgets proposed to and accepted by Ford Foundation, UNVFVT, CRY, etc. Over a period of 10 years (2004-2014), the monthly payments from all projects put together was Rs 39,000 per month for Teesta and Rs 23,500 per month for Javed. 4. On siphoning trust monies to Sabrang Communications (page 16 of the Affidavit). Alleged siphoning through Sabrang Communications: On requests from Sabrang Trust and CJP, Sabrang Communications (the oldest entity, a private limited company founded in 1993) agreed to share its office space, office equipment and staff on an expenses sharing basis. No rent was ever paid by ST or CJP to Sabrang Communications. The premises, which are owned by Teestaβ€™s parents, were given rent-free to SC. All payments by CJP and ST towards reimbursements for shared expenses were as per resolutions passed from time to time by their respective trustees. Teesta and Javed recused themselves from the decisions taken in all such instances. Sabrang Communications made no profit from this expenses sharing arrangement and Teesta and Javed were not paid even a rupee out of such reimbursements. 5. Allegation that we canβ€™t buy what we want from the remunerations received by us (page 19 of the affidavit). This allegation is too ridiculous to merit comment. 6. Funds raised through art auction by Sabrang Trust (page 21 of the Affidavit). The funds raised through the Art Auction were intended to support the core activities that have been spelt out at the very beginning. It was never claimed by the Trusts that the funds so raised were for financial help for victims. Indiaβ€™s leading artists gave generously of their works to support these endeavours due to the high regard for our work. 7. No accounts for legal aid work by CJP (page 24 of the Affidavit). Everyone in India and abroad, except for the Gujarat police, recognises the legal aid work undertaken by CJP, and its outcome. It is evident from the annual audited accounts of CJP submitted to the authorities (Income Tax, Charity Commissioner, Ministry of Home Affairs-FCRA) that 80-90 % of CJP s annual expenses are incurred on legal aid (including expenses on CJPβ€™s field office in Gujarat) to coordinate the legal work. Since its inception, CJP has fought 68 legal cases from trial court to Supreme Court β€“ a historic endeavour. 8. Allegations on funds raised for ambulances (page 26 of Affidavit). Donations to CJP were meant not only for purchase but the operating costs over the years (running) of two ambulances. The unspent amount of the funds earmarked for ambulances at the end of each year is in the balance sheet of CJP. 9. Funds Raised through art exhibition (page 27 of the Affidavit). Funds raised through the Art Exhibition were for the core activity of CJP which is legal aid. Top artists contributed generously of their work to support the cause of justice for the Survivors of mass crimes. Related: Bombay HC extends Setalvad's interim bail Indian Muslim
After being rejected an anticipatory bail by a Sessions Court, activist Teesta Setalvad and husband Javed Anand approached the Bombay High Court, which granted their anticipatory bail application for two weeks. This gave an interim relief for Teesta and Javed as they couldnβ€™t be arrested for two weeks now. Teesta and Javed were apprehending arrest by the Economic Offences Wing of the CBI on allegations of embezzlement of foreign funds received in the mane of her NGO, Sabrang Society. The CBI had registered a case against Teesta and Javed for violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) as they received foreign funds from US-based Ford Foundation without prior approval from the Government. Yesterday a Sessions court had rejected Teesta and Javedβ€™s anticipatory bail application. Quick to respond to the Sessions courtβ€™s order, Setalvadβ€™s lawyers filed an application in high court and mentioned it before Justice Mridula Bhatkar at 3 pm. In high court, the Centre told the judiciary that the nature of allegations against Setalvad and her husband was such that it could β€affect the Indian economyβ€. However, HC decided that Setalvad and her husband should not be arrested for two weeks granting their bail application. Comments
Social activist Teesta Seetalvad and her husband Javed Anand leave the sessions court after it rejected their bail plea on Friday. Later, they approached the HC, which granted them relief Salman Ansari dna The Bombay High Court on Friday granted interim relief to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand from being arrested in connection with a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly misappropriating Rs1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Granting temporary bail to the couple till August 10, Justice Mridula Bhatkar directed them to appear before the office of Economic Offences Wing of CBI on July 27 and 30 and on August 3 and 6 to record their statements between 12pm and 3pm. Teesta and Anand moved the HC after a special CBI court rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas and also refused to extend the interim relief granted to them earlier on July 17. Public Prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, appearing for CBI, argued that the offence was of a serious nature and custodial interrogation of the couple was required. However, the court refused to ask Setalvad and Anand to appear daily before the agency as they have been regularly attending their office. The court has posted their anticipatory bail petitions for final hearing on August 10. The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs1.8 crore ($2.9 lakh) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry.
"Some cricketers like Sreesanth and Chandilya were arrested in the IPL betting case and were in jail for a few days before they got bail. They seem to have been recently vindicated and may return to the game. In contrast, look at how our media and courts deal with a fraud-accused like Teesta Setalvad. I did not comment on the CBI court declining her anticipatory bail because I suspected the Bombay HC will come to her rescue. But sheβ€™s a β€victimβ€. Earlier when a court cancelled her bail a battery of lawyers held a β€Dial-a-bailβ€ video conference with the Supreme Court to get her bail in the late evening. But sheβ€™s a poor β€victimβ€. When the CBI court rejected her bail she claimed she was a victim of hate and vendetta. Some of her funders are convicted criminals like SantSingh Chatwal. Sant who? Heβ€™s the New York hotelier who was awarded a Padma Bhushan in January 2010 by the Congress govt. And then there is Ford Foundation and many others. All these guys were moved to tears by Teestaβ€™s fight for justice. Let us leave it at that. That she was fraudulently funded with help by the Congress is not a big secret. The money trail also makes fantastic reading. I am not going to waste time repeating what is already in the public domain. Β For Teesta when courts vindicate Modi itβ€™s not acceptable but when courts slam her sheβ€™s being penalised for a petty crime: Now, in my previous post (Teesta Rudalis) I mentioned all the crooks in the media gathered to mourn her tragedy and situation. Of course, the reason is simple β€“ a conviction of Teesta is an indirect conviction of these crooks who fed on her filth to target political opponents. But it is one particular hypocritical moron who has been screaming his lungs out as if a great disaster has befallen a poor woman who has been working hard for justice. Hereβ€™s β€Wheeler Dealerβ€ Shekhar Gupta: Not just SG but all our media crooks danced at the fake cases against Amit Shah. I donβ€™t think people have forgotten the war-dance of Sreenivasan Jain. Never mind! I got curious on why this SG is so agitated against legal prosecution of what are evidently fraudulent financial transactions by Teesta. He calls it mere accounting issues: So called foolish editors who claim to be experts from finance to β€Bahubaliβ€ appear to have learned nothing from history. All it took to start off a serious investigation into the greatest political scandal of the 20th century was this β€“ A donation-cheque of $25000 issued to the Republican National Committee to re-elect Nixon, instead of being deposited into the RNC bank account, was endorsed to a Watergate burglar. That was followed by the famous Deep Throat quote: β€Follow the moneyβ€! Did Shekhar Gupta ever learn this? Does he remember that it was an ordinary endorsement of a cheque to a burglar that finally led to the resignation of a US president? No, obviously not. So why is this β€wheeler-dealerβ€ so vocally defending the financial crimes of some political activist like Teesta? Whatβ€™s his stake? And he even goes on to say CBI is hounding Teesta for some crap like Tampons and stuff: (By the way, this is the same hypocrite SG who ranted about Kiran Bedi fudging some travel bills to benefit her NGO rather than personal enrichment and considers Teestaβ€™s frauds an accounting issue). And hereβ€™s the beauty about Ford Foundation: Okay SG! Did you ever ask SoniaG how she allowed FF to operate in India then? CBI hounds people for buying tampons and silly love stories with donation money? Thatβ€™s the intelligence of our so-called editors. Firstly, many disagree, but I am absolutely clear that Teesta is an anti-national and is a threat to national security. Hereβ€™s why: Teesta took the Gujarat riots issue to politicise it internationally. She took it to the Geneva Human Rights Organisation when the matter was already in our courts. What were her motives if not to tarnish the image of India and our courts (other than her political motives for Congress against Modi)? The Supreme Court rightly warned her \You seem to have more faith in foreign organisations than this court. It seems that witnesses would be protected by these organisations,\"" the bench remarked adding that if such letters are written then the court would pass the order without hearing the contentions of the CJPβ€¦ If you send such letters then we would hear the amicus curie and pass the order (without hearing you),\"" the court said adding, \""All the cases are being monitored by us, we don't like any correspondence of her with foreign agencies\"". Not an anti-national act? Not for SG, I suppose. Next, Teesta testifies with the US Commission on religious freedoms (some US based groups against Modi organised this nonsense). You testify with a US commission for your political persuasions and motives? Who else had she talked to and is still talking to? And she LIED even that to that Commission. The fraud that she is, she claims riots happened in Gujarat only since 1998 when BJP came to power. Any idiot (even a fool like Shekhar Gupta would know) that Gujarat has a history of riots β€“ the worst being 1969 and 1985 under Congress rule. This fraudulent liar is who our media Rudaalis claim is a poor victim? So I had to ask myself the question β€“ Why is SG so agitated about a petty thief like Teesta and political foot-soldier? What is his obsession in whining for her? That reminded me of an old article I had written on this blog β€“ Commie mediaβ€™s anti-Hindu poison. I recollected the name STRATFOR because I had quoted an article by that organisation in that post. Then it struck me why SGβ€™s tampons are in a twist over this self-confessed petty offender like Teesta. So I posted this tweet asking the question: When I first wrote about Stratfor and SG being the only contact they had in India, it was written in a different context and a different topic. Now the question that crosses my mind is in the tweet above β€“ Does SG too have tampons to hide in his closet? He has never denied his links with Stratfor. All these agenda-morons who pass for editors often write a lot of stuff in their short resume in Opeds and articles β€“ β€Editor for IE, formerly with HT, Rhodes scholar, Eminent political observerβ€ and so on. I have never once seen SG or any media house ever mentioning his being a worker for Stratfor. Obviously, I have to assume, SG is not a social β€workerβ€ (like Teesta?) who would do things for free for groups like Stratfor. Would he? And now that I recalled it β€“ this Stratfor is far more sinister it appears. It has links to CIA, it spied on the Bhopal Gas activists to provide information to Dow Chemicals for protective measures. All this went on without the knowledge of SG? Nobody in the media or the then GOI asked any questions to SG about this sinister organisation. But why would the Congress ask any questions to SG anyway? After all, this β€wheeler dealerβ€ was β€Doctoring & Nursingβ€ the Congress when it was evidently dying. There is something more alarming in the report that was based on the Wikileaks: A mix of covert and overt informants? Makes me assume SG had to be a covert operator since he has never disclosed it anywhere (till Wikileaks blew the lid) as far as I know and I am open to correction if someone can provide me such information on his disclosure. And the operators were being paid via Swiss banks and prepaid credit cards? Interesting! So let me understand this from some expert β€“ If I get a payment through a Swiss bank where would that be reflected? If it were me β€“ it would be reflected in my normal Indian bank account. But hereβ€™s another thing β€“ operators were also paid by β€Prepaid credit cardsβ€ β€“ which means it will not be reflected anywhere in any account of mine. Clever operation; eh? And SG was also ignorant of Hamid Gul of ISI being a member of Stratfor? Extraordinary! You can read the full article at Hardnews. Like I said in my post β€Teesta Rudalisβ€, all those whining for her appear to be worried investigating her may reveal a lot more on our media pimps who dismiss her frauds as β€petty offencesβ€. In December 2014 Caravan Magazine ran an article on the phenomenal wealth acquired by SG. Let us assume all that is legitimate β€“ after all SG is an expert in β€accountingβ€ but there are other questions he must answer. What was his role with Stratfor? Did they pay him? And why is he called a β€Wheeler Dealerβ€ in the Capital? Maybe the GOI should look into all this with a fine tooth-comb. Deep Throat left us with his wisdom for eternity β€“ β€Follow the moneyβ€."""
By Irfan Engineer, In an interview to CNNβ€™s Freed Zakaria ahead of his US visit in 2014, Prime Minister Modi said that Indian Muslims would live and die for India and would not want to do anything bad for India. (Express News Service, 2014). PM Modi while addressing a gathering at the Nazerbayev University in Astana, the capital of Kazakastan on July 8, 2015, underlined the common Islamic heritage of both India and Central Asia, which, according to him, would always reject the forces of extremism. According to the Indian PM, the Islamic heritage of both India and Central Asia, founded on the principle of love and devotion, was defined by the highest ideals of Islam, viz. knowledge, piety, compassion and welfare. β€The dargahs of Delhi resonate with Sufi music that draws people from all faithsβ€, he said (PTI, 2015). The PM made similar statement earlier in Nay Pyi Taw delinking religion andterror. Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh too claimed that Indian Muslims are patriots and that Islamic State (IS) has failed to attract them. However, in the year 2001, Narendrea Modi had claimed, β€All Muslims are not terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslimsβ€. Later, the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi used this statement extensively in his subsequent election campaigns. Following the 2002 massacre of Muslims and sexual assaults on Muslim women in many districts of Gujarat, there was anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic frenzy being whipped up by Gujarati media. Modi did nothing to assuage this frenzy. His sadbhavana fasts came years later, and even then there were questions about his sincerity. Modi seemed to provide justification to the rioters committing mayhem on streets β€“ rioting, according to him, was a reaction to the action of burning S-6 compartment of Sabarmati Express, which he had then concluded without police investigation to be a conspiracy of Muslims. Later the Gujarat police did prove the conspiracy before the trial court but the verdict is under appeal. The massacre of Muslims in Gujarat was followed a gaurav yatra undertaken by Modi invoking β€Gujarati prideβ€™, which he claimed was hurt by the secularists who stigmatized all Gujaratis for the 2002 carnage. He would typically ask the people he was addressing β€“ β€Are you all murderers?β€ The next state assembly elections after the riots were fought against not the opposition Congress party, but β€the Mian Musharrafβ€ mentality of Muslims. Mian is a derogatory term used for Muslims and Musharraf was the then President of Pakistan. The term intended to signify that Muslims were loyal to Pakistan and both needed to be shown their place by the voters. While Modi was the Chief Minister of the state, Gujarat Police gunned down several Muslims alleging them to be terrorists belonging to outfits across the border. Murder of Sohrabuddin and Ishrat Jehan was later investigated and the then Home Minister of Gujarat β€“ Amit Shah and several police officers were accused of the offence. Prime Minister Modi is not offering any explanation as to which of his numerous assessments of Indian Muslims really represents his honest opinion? Or have his opinions changed? What new information he received which led to the change? Minister of Home Affairs Rajnath Singh too had claimed in his address to the Directors-General of Police, Inspectors-General of Police and heads of Central Police Organisations in November 2014 that IS was trying to get a foothold in the Indian sub-continent, while Al-Qaeda had formed a branch for the Indian sub-continent keeping in view the Muslim population of Gujarat, Assam, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir and Bangladesh, and convert Indian sub-continent into Islamic State. Such a threat could not be taken lightly, though he hoped that Al-Qaeda was proved wrong. Indian Muslims and terrorism: Irrespective of answers to the above questions, it is true that Indian Muslims have contributed negligible human resources to the global terror networks. 140 million Indian Muslims is second largest population in the world, next only to Indonesia. Indian security forces and intelligence agencies have so far been able to trace four youth who emigrated to join the war led by self-appointed Islamic Khalifa β€“ Abu Bakr Baghdadi of IS. The four youth β€“ Areeb Majeed, Shaheen Tanki, Fahad Sheikh and Aman Tandel β€“ were from Kalyan. Honey trap and ideology misusing Islam were deployed to lure the youth. Areeb Majeed returned disappointed from the IS led war as the β€womanβ€ who was corresponding with him abruptly discontinued all the social media accounts that were being deployed to communicate with him. The well qualified youth were asked to do menial non-combatant jobs. What put off Areeb was the treatment of women by the IS combatants. Besides these four youth, there were reports of a 24-year-old executive in an Indian multinational company and resident of Bengaluru β€“ Mehdi Masroor Biswas β€“ who was accused of broadcasting ISβ€™s terror mission and luring recruits to fight in the Baghdadi led army through his twitter handle @ShamiWitness. Mehdi wastracked after he gave his interview to Channel 4. The intelligence agencies, having their own interests and training to suspect educated Muslim youth as terrorists on flimsy grounds, have claimed 20 youths from India are in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan fighting with the Islamic insurgents or at least providing assistance to them. Areeb claimed there were a few recruiters of IS in the country. Yet why are they failing so utterly? If such an utterly pitiable number of Muslim youth have been recruited for IS, what must be the reasons? Compare this with more than 20,000 foreigners from 90 countries, recruited to fight for the IS. As many as 3,400 fighters were drawn from Western states, according to Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center β€“ 180 Americans, according to National Intelligence Director James Clapper; 130 Canadians; 1,200 French fighters; 600 UK nationals β€“ five recruited every week; 50 Australians and 600 Germans. Bangladesh too has only few recruits β€“ Hafizur Rahman, Asif Adnan, 26, Fazle Elahi Tanzil, 24, and three others were arrested by Bangladesh security agencies for being recruited to fight IS war. Samiun Rahman alias Ibne Hamdan β€“ a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin was recruiting Bangladeshis from the northern city of Sylhet for IS war.He was targeting Muslims from Bangladesh as well asMyanmar (Hall, 2014). Police arrested Aminul Islam, IT head of a Coca Cola unit and Sakib Bin Kamal, a school teacher for recruiting 25 Bangladeshi youth for IS. Why Indians havenβ€™t joined global terror networks? The Hindu nationalist organisations never took note of this fact. They stigmatized that all terrorists were Muslims. Averments that Indian Muslims would not go against the interest of India and that they are patriots have been basically made during visits to Muslim dominated countries or while speaking to foreign media to project moderate image. However, the issue is why Indian Muslims havenβ€™t? Let us list down some probable reasons: 1) The religious leadership of Indian Muslims is largely drawn from the seminary Darul Uloom Deoband, and other seminaries too e.g., Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow. The Darul Uloom Deoband controls thousands of small seminaries and chain of madrasas and maktabas. Ulama of Deoband, organized into Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, have long back issued fatwa during a meeting attended by thousands of clerics and students on the Ramlila Grounds in Delhi against terrorism. They vowed to wipe out terrorism. According to the rector Habibur Rehman β€Islam rejects all kinds of unjust violence, breach of peace, bloodshed, murder and plunder and does not allow it in any form.β€ Jamiat held a series of conferences and meetings with madrassas in Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Surat, Varanasi and Kolkata to carry forward the anti-terror movement. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind booked entire train and scores of their membersand supporters travelled giving message of peace and opposing terrorism. However, Indian clerics are not the only ones to issue fatwa against terrorism. Such fatwas have been issued by other clerics as well, e.g. by MaulanaTahirul Quadri, a Pakistani cleric of Minhajul Quran now based in Canada. Religious leadership of Muslims in US and other countries also have issued such fatwas. 2) By and large Islam spread its influence in India by peaceful preaching. The first encounter with Islam was through Arab traders on the coast of Kerala in the 7th Century. As a result, Muslims retain their local traditions and culture and share the common heritage with non-Muslims. To give just a few instances, Muslims in Lakshadweep follow matrilineal traditions. Onam is as important a festival for Muslims as for non-Muslims in Kerala. Amir Khusroβ€™s compositions on Holy, Maulana Hasrat Mohaniβ€™s regular visits to Mathura and love of Lord Krishna, Ras Khanβ€™s compositions on Krishna, Bismillah Khanβ€™s shehnai dedicated to Lord Shiva and Dara Shikohβ€™s translations of Upanishads in Persian are just a few of many diverse instances of shared cultural traditions before Britishers encouraged communal divisions. Islamic influence in India largely grew on account of inclusive sufi traditions which served, fed and attracted the most marginalized and excluded sections of the society. Love was the basic religion the sufi (and bhakti) saints knew. The sufi doctrine is based on wahadatul wujud β€“ unity of being β€“ all beings are one and creation of God. Sufis also believed in suh-i-kul β€“ total peace β€“ embracing everyone. Peace within oneself and with external environment. Sulhi-i-kul is to be achieved by denying oneself all unnecessary selfish desires, fears (accept that of Allah), needs (accept basic ones needed to keep oneβ€™s body and soul together), urges, greeds, etc. Nizamuddin Auliya would sing bhajans daily morning in praise of Lord Rama and Krishna. Aartis by Hindu women are part of traditions during the tazia procession in many towns and villages. Given these cultural roots and cultural consciousness, it is difficult, if not impossible, to convince Indian Muslim mind with ideology of jihad. Sufi ethos is ingrained in the Muslim consciousness. A common Muslim finds little common in culture of Arabs and Muslims of other countries. The wahabi-salafi Islamic traditions spend considerable resources and efforts to Arabize Muslims under the pretext of following β€correct traditionsβ€™ in accordance with Islam. However, their success is limited. Limited to the extent Muslims are excluded and made to feel alien, experience discrimination and suffer communal violence. Volumes have been written on the composite and shared regional culture across religious following. The growth of Hindu nationalists and their discourse would sadly contribute to Muslims turning to Arabization if only in search of unity amidst diversity of cultural traditions and language within the community. The feeling of alienation is much higher among the Muslims in some of the western countries. Most of them are from Asian origin and feel less at home in western cultures. Asians prefer to stay in neighbourhoods dominated by their own communities. Cultural alienation among youth, growth of racist forces which target Islam informed by β€clash of civilizationβ€™ theory and participation of western armies in war against Iraq and Afghanistan create more conducive environment for Islamist to recruit youth for their war. 3) Urge to take revenge has been one reason for the Muslim youth in India to undertake terrorist activities. The March 12, 1993 bombs, bomb attacks in Zaveri bazaar and several other places on March 18, 2003, the bomb blasts in Ghatkopar BEST bus on July 28, 2003, terror attack in several suburban trains on July 11, 2006 in Mumbai are some instances where Muslim youth were involved. However, that was out of desire to take revenge for 1992-93 communal violence in Mumbai and 2002 carnage in Gujarat. Several accused convicted for the offences relating to March 12, 1993 bomb blasts said in their statements during the trial that they participated in the conspiracy as they saw their near and dear ones being killed during the 1992-93 riots in Mumbai.Justice Srikrishna (1998) in his report links the communal riots and the bomb blasts with the following words: β€One common link between the riots ... and bomb blasts of 12th March 1993 appears to be that the former appear to have been a causative factor for the latter. ... The serial bomb blasts were a reaction to the totality of events at Ayodhya and Bombay in December 1992 and January 1993.β€™ The resentment among large number of Muslim youth was exploited by the Pakistani agencies. However, democracy in India is working much better than in many other Muslim countries. Though justice is slow, with human rights crusaders like Teesta Setalvad and other organizations, it was possible to get justice for the victims of Gujarat riots. Some accused were convicted and are behind bars. Those accused of Ishrat Jahan and Sohrabuddin case are still facing trial. Extra judicial murders by security forces have come down drastically with all such murders being problematized by human rights organizations. Given the hope for justice, there is less desire for revenge and hence negligible success of the IS recruiters in India. The democratic space for the marginalized is shrinking in India. It is under attack from a section of Hindu nationalists who have been emboldened to stigmatize Muslims and other minorities with calls to take away their right to vote, instigating them by calling them to go to Pakistan, calling madrasas as den of terrorism. Shrinking of democratic space and victimization of human right activists like Teesta Setalvad is cause for worry. Will we able to ward off IS and keep Muslim youth from terrorism for long? The democratic forces within the community seem to be strong enough. However, all marginalized sections would have to come together to defend and deepen democracy in India.

Legal Correspondent New Delhi, March 19The Supreme Court today restrained the Gujarat police from arresting social activist Teesta Setalvad until her anticipatory bail plea was tested by a larger Bench on the touchstone of personal liberty on one side and the need for custodial interrogation on the other. A Bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel passed the order on the plea of Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a case of alleged misappropriation of donations collected for the rehabilitation of 2002 riots victims. The accused had collected over Rs 8 crore in the name of their two NGOs, Citizen for Peace and Justice and Sabrang Trust.Β  β€We think it appropriate that the matter should be heard by a larger Benchβ€ as the petitionersβ€™ plea involved issues of value of liberty, concept of regulated freedom, societal restriction, supremacy of law, concept of anticipatory bail and the police assertion that the accused were not cooperating with the investigating officer. Police said custodial interrogation of the two accused was necessary to recover the funds, collected from overseas organisations and within the country purportedly for converting Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Housing Society, where 68 people including ex-MP Ehsan Jafrey were killed in the riots, into a museum and rehabilitation of the victims.Β  According to the complainants, the couple had persuaded them against selling their flats in the society by promising them that they would get the value of their flats from the funds being raised for the museum. But the accused never bothered to pay them or construct the museum. Rather, they misappropriated the funds, including for their personal use. The accused have disputed the contentions and maintained that the alleged misappropriation was less than Rs 4 lakh and his clients had appeared before the police on the two occasions they were summoned.
New Delhi, March 19 The Supreme Court today referred to a larger Bench the petition filed by Teesta Setalvad and her husband seeking anticipatory bail in the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. The apex court, however, said that the interim order providing protection from arrest to Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand shall be extended till the larger Bench takes up the matter. While referring the matter to a larger Bench, a Bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the matter in hand raises several issues pertaining to concept of liberty in view of the offences enumerated in the case. The Bench also said that among the issues that needed to be discussed included supremacy of law, value of liberty, concept of regulated liberty, anticipatory bail and issue of non-cooperation during investigation by the accused. The two-judge Bench had on February 19 reserved its order in the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband who had challenged the Gujarat High Court order denying them the relief. The High Court in its February 12 judgement had observed that Setalvad and her husband were not cooperating in the probe and that β€they cannot be armoured with full-fledged anticipatory bail when applicants did not cooperate with the investigationβ€. Hours after the High Court had denied them the bail, they had moved the apex court and the bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu had granted stay of the order and posted the matter for next day. A Bench of justices S J Mukhopadhya (since retired) and N V Ramana had asked some tough questions to Setalvad and her husband for seeking anticipatory bail. It had extended the protection from arrest till February 19 when a new bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel further extended the stay and reserved the judgement. Setalvad and her husband have been booked by the Crime Branch of Gujarat Police on charges of cheating, breach of trust and under the IT Act, in a matter relating to the construction of β€Museum of Resistanceβ€ in Gulbarg Society in Ahmedabad which was hit by communal riots in 2002. The Bench headed by Justice Misra had clarified that non-cooperation by Teesta, a social activist, and her husband into the investigation would give liberty to the Gujarat Police to move application for cancellation of bail. It had also directed the accused to hand over the list of documents sought from them by the Gujarat Police to carry forward its investigation into the case. On February 28, 2002, in the aftermath of the Godhra train burning incident, armed rioters had swooped on the Gulbarg Society and killed 69 people, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri. One of the riot victims from Gulbarg Housing Society, which was burnt during the 2002 post-Godhra riots, had lodged a complaint with the Ahmedabad Police against Setalvad, Anand and two NGOs run by them β€” Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust β€” alleging misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 1.51 crore. According to the complaint, the accused persons had collected funds in the name of converting part of Gulbarg Society into a museum and had allegedly misappropriated funds worth Rs 1.51 crore. The accused had contended that they have been implicated in the case and were victims of political vendetta. They claimed that they were being targeted by the perpetrators of the riots. In 2006, the social activists decided to build the β€Museum of Resistanceβ€™ at the site of the Gulbarg Society. Accordingly in 2009, a part of the plot was sold to Sabrang Trust. However in 2012, the idea of the museum was dropped as the prices escalated. The same was communicated to the society. But, according to the complaint filed against Setalvad, funds were collected by her despite the idea being dropped. β€” PTI
[LINK TO SOLIDARITY STATEMENT BELOW] If you saw the programme on IBN7 last night, vilifying Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand, with BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra and Sangh spokesperson Rakesh Sinha at their asabhyaΒ virulent best, shouting down and intimidating mild Sandeep Pandey and shouting continuously throughout whatever feisty Priyanka Chaturvedi (Congress spokesperson) had to say (which was hard-hitting and unanswerable), you would know what the case against the two activists is really about. Of course, the charges against them are of corruption and embezzling of funds collected for Gujarat riot victims, but when Priyanka Chaturvedi pointed out that the case against them is dubious because Gujarat police and judiciary are not exactly exemplars of probity, given the assiduous stalking carried out by the GujaratΒ police on behalf of Modiβ€™s man, of a young womanΒ (whose family was paid off/ intimidated in classic Hindutva style, ending in the woman claiming gratitude for being stalked)Β they had no answer. (She could have addedΒ the blatant miscarriages of justice in cases of fake encounters and the Ishrat Jahan killing.) It was then that Rakesh Sinha started bellowing self-righteously about the journal Communalism Combat that has taken continuously anti-national stands on the execution of Kasab, on the issue of fair trials for people accused of terrorism and so on. How dare you defend such anti-national people, he roared threateningly while the anchor Sumit Awasthi smirked triumphantly. (Remember this is the news channel that sacked an Editor for raising his voice against its blatant pro-Modi bias in the Delhi election coverage).** Priyankaβ€™s calm reply was that the freedom to express political views against the government or which run contrary to dominant wisdom β€“ and Communalism Combat has not spared the Congress or the UPA β€“ is a constitutional right, which perhaps the current dispensation would like to do away with. But I must say it was a relief to hear the official spokespersons of Hindu right-wing formations clearly state what the problem is with Teesta and Javed β€“ not that they are petty embezzlers, but that they are β€anti-nationalβ€™ in the eyes of the Hindu Right. That is, they have consistently stood up for secular values and democratic rights, doggedly followed up on the cases against killers in the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, successfully getting some of them transferred out of the highly compromised state judiciary, and generally been a pain in the neck for the Hindu Right and for Modiβ€™sΒ Gujarat pogrom apologist regime. Thank you, Rakesh Sinha and Sambit Patra, for the virulence boiling in your system, which cannot stay under control even for strategic reasons! 1. Here is a petition we can sign to express solidarity with these indomitable activists: http://www.indiaresists.com/sign-petition-citizens-in-solidarity-with-teesta-setalvad-and-javed-anand/ 2. Statement from NAPM: NAPM is deeply disturbed with news from the Gujarat High Court refusing the anticipatory bail applications of rights activists Teesta Setalvad, Javed Anand and 3 others from Gulberg Society. We strongly feel that the High Court could have meticulously examined the extensive submissions put forth by Teesta, before rejecting the bail application, seeking dropping of charges. We also express our discontent with the sweeping observations made in the Order against social justice groups. Although there is temporary respite with the intervention of the Honβ€™ble Chief Justice of the Supreme Court today, it is a matter of extreme anxiety that β€armedβ€™ with the High Courtβ€™s order, the Gujarat police is keen to immediately arrest Teesta and others for β€custodial interrogationβ€. We hope the Supreme Court will appreciate the overall circumstances of the case, merits of the High Courtβ€™s order and observe as to whether at all there is any need for β€custodial interrogationβ€ of the bail applicants, at this stage of the legal process. It has been widely acknowledged that the Teesta, Javed and activists with the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and the Sabrang Trust withstood the might of the Gujarat State for more than 12 years and fearlessly stood with the victims and survivors of the gruesome riots, since 2002. The constant political vendetta by the ruling party, at the behest of communal outfits in the state is no hidden secret. NAPM is also worried at the increasing scenario of the present Govt. targeting rights activists, by making unsubstantiated allegations of financial irregularities and demand a halt to this approach. We call upon all peace-loving citizens, peopleβ€™s organizations and political parties to voice their protest and seek fairness and justice to the activists fighting relentlessly for the cause of Gujarat riot victims. We also demand full justice and rehabilitation to the riot-survivors who are having for wait endlessly for years from a very β€concerned Stateβ€™, which does not see the need of vigilante groups.

Statement from Peopleβ€™s Alliance for Secularism and Democracy (PADS): Peopleβ€™s Alliance for Democracy and Secularism (PADS) expresses alarm at the Gujarat Police move to arrest the two activists, Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand in Mumbai. The arrest of Teesta Setalvad, who was denied bail by the Gujarat High court, has been stayed for 24 hours at the intervention of the Supreme Court. Teesta Setalvad has been relentlessly championing the rights of the victims of the Gujarat pogroms of 2002. Her efforts resulted in the transfer of some of the riot related cases out of Gujarat and conviction of some bigwigs from the Gujarat government. The Government of Gujarat led by Anandiben Patel, the successor of the incumbent Prime Minister, is vindictive and has been after Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand for their bold stand in defence of the riot victims. Its aim seems to be to discourage anyone from taking legal recourse against misdeeds of the Gujarat government during and after the 2002 pogrom. A case of embezzlement of funds collected by their NGOs has been filed against Teesta, Javed and three others. Defendants have submitted documentary evidence in court against prosecution allegations. It must be noted that while the Gujarat government appears hell bent on targeting Teesta and her associates for standing up for riot victims, it has been reinstating the police officials who are facing serious criminal charges in fake encounter cases. The PADS demands that the Gujarat government stop harassing Ms. Teesta Setalvad and MrΒ Javed Anand β€“ whose anticipatory bail applications have been rejected by the Gujarat High Court today. 4.

"Coming out in support of Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, members of civil society, scholars and media personalities accused the government of \hounding\"" the two activists for daring to raise their voice against it. Setalvad, who has been working for providing justice to Gujrat riot victims, along with her husband has been facing legal actions for allegedly diverting foreign funds. \""The whole government machinery has been engaged in harassing and intimidating Setalvad and Javed. Is the government trying to say that look, these are consequences you will face if you dare to raise you voice against us?\"" asked Harsh Mander, Director, Centre for Equity Studies. Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabarang Trust, run by Teesta and Anand, were served notices by the Home Ministry about two months ago asking the NGOs why their registration under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) would not be cancelled as on-site inspection of records and books of accounts of the two found \""irregularities and financial misappropriation\"". Questioning the timing of government's action against Setalvad, activists alleged that it is an attempt to thwart her efforts to bring justice to the victims since the cases she has been fighting have reached crucial legal stage. \""Why is it all being done now after 12 longs years? They want to divert the attention by engaging her legal charges. They want to hamper the cases of the victims as they have reached crucial stages and carry 25,000 pages of evidence against important people in the government,\"" Madhu Prasad, a retired associate professor of Delhi University, said. \""The hounding of Teesta Setalvad is timed to coincide with the publicly articulated urge of the Prime Minister to get a 'clean chit' from the courts in relation to the ongoing cases in Gujarat, which Teesta has been doggedly pursuing. She is the victim of the pursuit for justice,\"" she added. Citizens for Justice and Peace is pursuing 68 cases of Gujarat riots, which have resulted in conviction of more than 120 people. Mander said that the investigation against the activists were \""politically motivated\"" and made with the \""intention of prosecuting\"" them for their human rights work. \""Gujarat would have been a similar story like other communal violence-hit areas where criminal cases were closed without single punishment if Setalvad had not decided to fight it for the victims. \""There is evidence beyond challenge against powerful people in the present government. So, there is an unsubtle attempt by the government to bully and silence people who are trying to raise questions which are fundamental for the future of secular democracy,\"" Mander said. Indian political and social activist Aruna Roy said that it was the failure of the government and its administration to provide justice to the survivors. \""Whenever there is communal violence, it is important to stop it immediately. The Gujarat violence was the failure of the administration as the government was not bother about it at all,\"" she alleged. Β """
The appeal has been filed by Teesta Setalvad and Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri who was killed during 2002 riots. The Gujarat High Court on Monday adjourned to August 4 the final hearing of Zakia Jafri's appeal against a lower court order upholding the clean chit given by special investigation team to then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and others for their alleged roles in 2002 riots. Justice Sonia Gokani adjourned the hearing after Jafri's lawyer S M Tirmizi sought more time to study case material.Β  The appeal has been filed by activist Teesta Setalvad and Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed during the post-Gohdra riots of 2002.Β Setalvad and Jafri had filed a complaint against Modi (who was then the Gujarat Chief Minister) and 62 others, including some then ministers, top police officials and BJP leaders for being party to a wider conspiracy regarding the riots in the Supreme Court.Β The apex court asked the SIT to probe the complaint. The SIT submitted a report to the Supreme Court, and the court asked amicus curie Raju Ramchandran to verify it. Ramchandran also submitted a report to the Supreme court. On September 12, 2011, the Supreme Court directed the SIT to submit its final report, along with the entire evidence material collected, to the local magistrate's court.Β Subsequently, the magistrate's court here, revealing the contents of the report, said that the SIT had given a clean chit to Modi and others.

Β The Gujarat High Court on Monday condoned the delay in filing a plea by social activist Teesta Setalvad to defreeze her bank accounts in the alleged fund embezzlement case and fixed the next hearing on August 5. Last month Setalwad had moved the plea to defreeze her bank accounts in an alleged embezzlement case wherein she had allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society to a 2002 riots museum, but allegedly spent money for personal purposes.Β The city crime branch had frozen the bank accounts of Setlavad, her husband Javed Anand and two of their NGOs' accounts after they began probe into the embezzlement case filed by a former resident of Gulberg Society last year. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had rejected their pleas to defreeze the bank accounts in November 2014.Β However, as the plea was filed 90 days after the order was given, the applicant filed to condone the delay. During the hearing today, Teesta's lawyer Kalpesh Shastri contended that the delay in filing the application was caused mainly because his client was busy trying for anticipatory bail from the Supreme Court. Justice Sonia Gokani took into account these explanations and admitted the application. The next hearing has been fixed on August 5. Β

Teesta Setalvad File Photo A group of activists, social workers, lawyers and eminent media personalitiesΒ on MondayΒ held a press conference to show their solidarity with activist Teesta Setalvad, and to pointedly raise questions to the government for digging up a 12-year-old issue, timing suspiciously with the hearing of the case filed by Zakia Jafri against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and 59 others in the 2002 Godhra riots case. Social activist and writer Harsh Mander said that a state-sponsored pogrom like the Godhra riots need to be fought to ensure that this does not happen again. β€If we allow state-sponsored violence to go unquestioned and unchecked, the idea of India will fall apart,β€ he said, citing how the victims of the 1983 Delhi riots, the 1993 Bombay riots and the 2002 Nellie massacre are still not compensated. Teesta Setalvad, and her husband Javed Anand have been working to ensure justice for 2002 Gujarat riots victims, and has been working on 68 cases, some at the trial courts, some at the High Court, while a few at the Supreme Court. So far, 120 accused have been convicted in these cases. Early this month, the CBI registered a case against Teesta and her husband for violating funds and under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), and for criminal conspiracy. After investigations, the CBI declared her a β€threat to national securityβ€. The High Court refused her an anticipatory bail, after which she moved Supreme Court, which gave her interim relief till July 10. Teesta has made public her documents since, and her statement to the court runs to 25,000 pages. Β  The activists questioned the timing of Β the case, as it coincided with the hearing of the Zakia Jafri case, adjourned at the moment as the Gujarat government said it needed more time for a response. Writer-journalist Manoj Mitta, whose bookΒ The Fiction of The Fact-finding: Modi and GodhraΒ raised several such questions said that had it not been for Teesta, there would not have been 120 convictions in the Gulberg massacre. β€The kind of persecution she is facing should be fought,β€ he said. Β  Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan said that Teesta is framed for specific reasons. β€Today, the Central government is putting its might to ensure that those accused in the 2002 riots are either released or reinstated, some even in offices like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On the other hand, Teesta is hounded by being framed in a bogus case and without any proof, they want to have a custodial interrogation. The message is quite clear,β€ said Bhushan. Β  CHARGES AGAINST TEESTA In 2014, the Ahmedabad crime branch filed a case against Teesta Setalvad, Tanvir Jafri and others, on the behest of Feroze Khan Pathan, also a victim of Gulbarg massacre, for alleged fraud. They claimed that Teesta had collected Rs 1.51 crore to build a memorial for the 69 GulbargaΒ Society victims killed in the massacre. The HC pressed for her custodial interrogation, and Supreme Court in February this year stayed her arrest. In her reply, Teesta has showed that only Rs 4.6 lakh were collected for the memorial, and it remains untouched. Early this month, the CBI registered a case against Teesta and her husband for violating FCRA norms. The complaint said that she took funds from foreign bodies like the Ford Foundation without notifying the Ministry of Home Affairs, and that she did not have separate accounts for domestic and foreign funds. The complaint also said that as the editor of a monthly she wrote for other publications. Teestaβ€™s reply, running into 25,000 pages, has made her dealings public, and she is currently under interim relief from a Supreme Court order. Β Β  Β 
New Delhi : The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad for allegedly receiving funds from foreign entities without prior permission from the government.Β The FIR also names Teestaβ€™s husband Javed Anand, businessman Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and Sabrang Communications and Publishing.Β The CBI is currently examining Sabrangβ€™s documents and bank account details, with media reports speculating that the trio may soon be questioned by the agency.
By Mazhar Farooqui The hanging of Yakub Memon will not shake Indian Muslimsβ€™s faith in the countryβ€™s judiciary and democratic values. That bit was already taken care of when Afzal Guru was sent to the gallows to satisfy the β€collective conscienceβ€ of the society. When the killers of Ishrat Jehan, Ahsan Jafri, Kausar Bi, Sadiq Sheikh, Sohrabuddin and countless others were not just let off the hook but also awarded with plum promotions. When Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, DG Vanzara, PP Pandey etc. were given β€clean chitsβ€ despite damning evidence. When the blood thirsty PAC cops who murdered 43 Muslim youths in Hashimpura were acquitted by the court. When Shiv Sena thugs who were named and shamed in the Srikrishna report for raping and killing hundreds of Muslims during the 1993 Mumbai riots were never brought to book and their leader was instead given a state funeral when he died a natural death. When Kalyan Singh, who reneged on a Supreme Court affidavit pledging to protect the Babri Masjid, was detained in a posh guest house for just few hours as punishment for an act that led to the biggest riots in India since partition. When convicted killers like Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajragni, who lorded over the massacre of Muslim women and children, were given a seemingly endless parole. When the government launched a relentless witch hunt against people like Sanjiv Bhatt and Teesta Setalvad, who dared to stand for Muslims. When brave Mumbai lawyer Shahid Azmi, who defended young Muslims framed on bogus terror charges, was gunned down and his killers were honourably discharged. When the government at the Centre restrained the investigating agency to act against Hindu extremists facing trial in the Samjhauta Express and Mecca Masjid blast cases. When fake encounters were trumpeted as genuine. When a Times of India report found that a three-fourths of those given the death penalty belonged to backward classes, religious minorities and economically weaker sections. So the bottom line is: Yaqub Memonβ€™s hanging wonβ€™t alienate Muslims more than what some of these past events already have. - Mazhar Farooqui is a Dubai-based Indian journalist.

Ahmedabad:Β  The Gujarat High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the state government and a complainant on a plea by social activist Teesta Setalvad seeking quashing of an FIR in a case in which she is accused of putting objectionable pictures of Hindu deities on a social networking site. Justice J B Pardiwala issued notices to government and Raju Patel, the complainant, over the social activist's plea to quash the FIR against her registered at Gathlodia Police Station here. The High Court also asked the investigating officer in the case to remain present in court on September 30, the next date of hearing. The FIR was filed in August last year on a complaint by Mr Patel, who said Ms Setalvad had uploaded objectionable images of Hindu Gods and Goddesses on her Twitter account. She was booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 153(a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups) and section 205(a) (committing a deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings by insulting religion or religious beliefs) along with IT Act. The 53-year-old activist had later apologised and removed the images from her Twitter account.

Endless Quest for justice Mumbai 1992-1993: Punish the Guilty admin on July 30, 2015 at 1:00 AM 0 Shares By Teesta Setalvad The Congress-led Democratic Front (DF) government in Maharashtra is a year away from completing two terms in power. Quite apart from the rest of its record vis-Γ -vis electoral promises, this governmentβ€™s failure to deliver on justice to victims of the 1992-1993 pogroms in Mumbai following the Babri Masjid demolition smacks of political doublespeak. In 1999, and again in 2004, β€implementation of the Justice BN Srikrishna Commission reportβ€™ topped the alliance manifestoβ€™s list of pre-poll promises. As CC investigated and reported last year, following Right to Information (RTI) applications made by its co-editor Teesta Setalvad, the policemen indicted in the Mumbai violence were let off by the DF government with token punishments, if any. As for politicians responsible for fomenting violence through hate speech, it was the state executiveβ€™s procrastination and the state judiciaryβ€™s acquittal of Shiv Sena (SS) supremo Bal Thackeray and other members of the political class that has accorded impunity. Madhukar Sarpotdar, Manohar Joshi and Gopinath Munde were some SS-BJP politicians accused in serious criminal cases who escaped judicial indictment. Under the SS-BJP government, a DGP-level committee under Arvind Inamdar was appointed to scrutinise 1,371 β€Aβ€™ summary (true but closed) cases and decided to reopen/reinvestigate 112 of these. Of the 112 cases reopened, charge-sheets were filed in only eight cases. Five of these have resulted in acquittal and three are pending trial. Following the formation of the first DF government in Maharashtra and a cabinet decision in this regard, a Special Task Force (STF) under the police Crime Branch was appointed to scrutinise riot related cases. According to information provided to campaign groups, the STF re-examined the entire record, reopening nine cases and registering eight new cases that found no mention in either the DGP committeeβ€™s report or in the Srikrishna Commission report. The eight new cases registered included one against Gajanand Kirtikar, former SS-BJP minister of state for home, whom the STF charge-sheeted. For over 12 years now, the issue of implementation of the Srikrishna Commission reportβ€™s recommendations has been awaiting final judicial attention. Citizens took the matter first to the Bombay High Court and then the Supreme Court (in five separate petitions and two special leave petitions that have now been clubbed together). But despite rigorous efforts to obtain meaningful directions from the Supreme Court, which include the appointment of a monitoring committee to supervise remedial measures, a long line of adjournments has been the only real result so far. Only twice in the course of this legal battle have the courts responded, without spectacular result. On both occasions this was due largely to public outcry and pressure. First, in 2000, after the DF government filed an affidavit before the apex court detailing failures to act against errant policemen. A series of public meetings followed, including one held by CC and others at Mumbaiβ€™s KC College on September 24, 2000 which helped refocus attention on non-payment of reparation amounts to the families of persons who were β€missingβ€™ after the brutal violence (see CC, October 2000). Now, six years later, since July-August 2007 the issue has been in focus once again. Not long after the tragic serial train blasts shook Mumbai in July 2006, prompting Judge PD Kode to start delivering his September 2006 judgement in the bomb blasts case of March 1993, this writer began reporting concurrently on the reality and perception of a system of discriminatory justice. About three months before the serial bomb blasts rocked the city and the country for the first time in March 1993, Bombay was torn apart by the politics of hatred and division in which over 1,100 people lost their lives in December 1992-January 1993. A vast majority of those who were targeted, people who were selectively killed and their homes and businesses destroyed, belonged to Indiaβ€™s largest minority, its Muslims. Thus even as the nation celebrated punishment of the guilty yet bemoaned judicial delay when it came to bomb terror, this was accompanied by the sombre reminder that Maharashraβ€™s police, judiciary and executive had failed to mete out punishment to all those guilty of mob terror. Once the judgement in the Bombay serial blasts case was read and sentences were meted out, the media began its campaign on the issue of discriminatory justice and the non-implementation of the Srikrishna Commission report. The issue fast spiralled into a mass campaign as newly formed citizensβ€™ groups such as β€Justice for Allβ€™ and β€Nyaya Andolanβ€™ promised mass agitation and action. Forced to respond to this public outcry, the state government was compelled to meet citizensβ€™ groups and assured them that justice would indeed be done. Today, five months into the campaign and after more than three dozen meetings with representatives of the state government and the police, the Maharashtra governmentβ€™s sincerity in its intent to pursue swift prosecution of these cases stands seriously exposed. Pushed to divulge overall figures and statistics following RTI disclosures and the public campaign, the Maharashtra government has had to admit that in the 894 charge-sheets filed with relation to the mob terror of 1992-1993, the record of convictions is pathetic β€“ only 27 cases have resulted in convictions. Shockingly, as many as 539 cases have resulted in acquittals or discharge, most of which the state has not thought fit to appeal. Seventy-five cases have been listed separately under a β€Dormant Fileβ€™ on the grounds that the accused are absconding. During extended discussions between citizensβ€™ groups and advocates in the Supreme Court with representatives of the Maharashtra government (including the chief minister, home minister and senior bureaucrats), it was agreed that about 30-35 cases representing premeditation, hate speech and the role of the mahaartis (politico-religious β€pujasβ€™ organised jointly by both the SS and the BJP locally in Mumbai), all of which resulted in mass crimes, would be selected and assigned to special fast track courts This process began in August 2007. Citizensβ€™ groups have also been arguing with the state for a professional reinvestigation team of the highest calibre and integrity. Without fresh investigations, the lapse of time could seriously hinder the quality of evidence in the cases assigned to the special fast track courts. It is also necessary that a team of specially appointed public prosecutors be instituted and without which the entire exercise would be rendered meaningless as none of the cases would actually result in convictions. Campaign groups also insisted that cases against politicians like Bal Thackeray, Gopinath Munde and Madhukar Sarpotdar, which had resulted in acquittal due to weak prosecutions or poor judgements, should be appealed after the courts had been asked to condone delay. None of this has been done. Even the case against Gajanand Kirtikar, pending in the Jogeshwari Sessions Court (CR No. 8/93), has not been picked for transfer to the special fast track courts. In the most recent communication between the government and citizensβ€™ groups in late December 2007, citizens were informed that 16 cases had been marked out for transfer to the special fast track courts. But for two exceptions, the RD Tyagi firing (Usman Suleiman Bakery) case, as also the case involving another policeman, former inspector Wahule, it is evident from a perusal of this list that the DF government is disinclined to prosecute the more serious crimes or criminals. Worse still, the state of Maharashtra continues to criminally prosecute and harass eyewitnesses who have been privy to brutal actions by the Mumbai police. It has been a demand of the citizensβ€™ campaign that specious cases against both Farooq Mapkar (eyewitness to the Hari Masjid firing in which six persons were shot dead by PSI Nikhil Kapse) and Maulana Nurul Huda of the Darul-Uloom (eyewitness to the Usman Suleiman Bakery firing where nine people were gunned down by policemen led by then joint commissioner of police RD Tyagi) be dropped. Hari Masjid case Justice BN Srikrishna, while examining evidence in the police case against Mapkar and others filed by PSI Kapse alleging that Mapkar and a mob were responsible for setting fire to slums, dubbed these allegations against Farooq Mapkar, one of those injured in the Hari Masjid firing, as β€wholly unbelievableβ€ and β€fabricatedβ€. In 2006, a trial court had acquitted 49 other accused in the case for want of evidence. The case dates back to January 10, 1993 when six people died in police firing at Hari Masjid in Sewri. The police claimed they were attacked by an armed mob of 2,000-2,500 persons and fired in self-defence. Nikhil Kapse, then a subinspector at RAK Marg police station, filed a complaint alleging that the mob set some slums on fire in a Hindu locality near the mosque. This was obviously an attempt by Kapse to trap those who were witness to his illegal and brutal acts. All the accused, except Mapkar, have been acquitted; Mapkar was 35th on the list. He was also one of those injured in the firing and a witness to the entire incident. In 2006, Mapkarβ€™s case was separated from the rest on the charge that he β€was not cooperatingβ€. In September 2007, even as dialogues with citizensβ€™ groups continued, the Mumbai police filed a fresh charge-sheet against Mapkar, now charging him with murder and rioting. Policemen Arun Ghadge and NG Wayal performed this task even as the campaign to β€Punish the Guiltyβ€™ was under way. Interestingly, however, in 2006, during his deposition before the court which acquitted the remaining accused, Ghadge claimed that he was not even in the locality on the day the incident took place. Curiously, the fresh charge-sheet against Mapkar comes after the campaign gathered momentum and only serves to demonstrate the Mumbai policeβ€™s utter reluctance to prosecute those guilty of mob terror in 1992-1993, particularly its policemen. To recapitulate events β€“ the Srikrishna Commission report held Kapse, now an assistant police inspector, β€guilty of unjustified firingβ€ and β€inhuman and brutal behaviourβ€. The commission recorded victimsβ€™ statements on β€how the police resorted to unprovoked firingβ€. Clearly, the state of Maharashtraβ€™s public stance and the behaviour of its own police force within the courtroom are proving contradictory. Even as the β€Justice for Allβ€™ campaign built up (and other accused in the fabricated case were acquitted) Mapkar, an eyewitness and victim of police brutality, is today being further victimised. Thus Farooq Mapkar, who is accused in RAK Marg Police Station CR No. 17/1993, has been compelled to address the high court for redressal against this injustice and has filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court asking that his matter be transferred for investigation by the CBI. In yet another cynical round of musical chairs, while the Maharashtra government assured Mapkar and campaign groups that the matter would indeed be transferred for investigation in October 2007, a month later the CBI announced that it had declined to accept the relevant Maharashtra government order. Usman Suleiman Bakery case One of the worst incidents of December 1992-January 1993 was the gunning down, in cold blood, of nine labourers and bakery workers in the premises of the Usman Suleiman Bakery at Chunabhatti by a contingent of policemen led and inspired by the then joint commissioner of police RD Tyagi. Tyagi and his men attempted to justify their brutal actions by claiming they were gunning down Kashmiri terrorists! This is another of the 1992-1993 riot related cases that has deliberately not been seriously prosecuted by the state and worse, has resulted in a key witness to the incident, Maulana Nurul Huda, being harassed and persecuted through a criminal prosecution against which he has filed a criminal revision application No. 357/ 2002-2003 which is pending before the Bombay High Court. A daily wage earner, Hudaβ€™s life has been reduced to a series of interminable court appearances against a malicious and motivated prosecution. Following the STFβ€™s reinvestigation of this case, a first information report was filed by a policeman, Mirza Baig, in 2000. Tyagi and 17 other policemen were prosecuted but through an order dated April 16, 2003, a sessions court in Mumbai discharged Tyagi and eight of the accused. The remaining accused face trial and the case is still pending. Though in 2005 the state government filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court stating that they would appeal the discharge order in the Tyagi case, no such action has been forthcoming. In a recent about-turn, the state governmentβ€™s affidavit of December 2007 states that opinion was sought from the concerned public prosecutor (Rohini Salian) who opined that the case was not fit for appeal due to lack of evidence. Now, following increasing public pressure, the state says that the matter is being re-examined by the law and judiciary department to reconsider its decision not to appeal. The governmentβ€™s stand in the Supreme Court too leaves much to be desired. It was only after consistent pressure from citizensβ€™ groups that the state government filed a 500-page affidavit accepting some of the contentions laid out by the campaign. But even today, 18 years into a frustrating process of litigation and six months into a renewed citizensβ€™ campaign, we have no guarantees of justice. The β€secularβ€™ Democratic Front government in Maharashtra appears shifty and morally ambivalent on the issue of punishing the guilty. It seems more comfortable shielding the perpetrators of mass communal crimes, many of whom have joined the ranks of the Congress and NCP themselves.

"MUMBAI: In a 13-page order rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, a special CBI court expressed fears over them tampering with evidence, in the event the pleas were allowed. \Custodial interrogation is necessary. At this stage, I do not find any substance in enlarging the applicants on anticipatory bail,\"" special judge A A Khan had said. Soon after the plea was rejected, the couple moved the Bombay high court which extended the interim protection from arrest till August 10. Setalvad and Anand filed the pleas though their advocate Vijay Hiremath in the aftermath of the searches carried at four places, including her Juhu residence and their office of Sabrang Communications and Publishing. The raid was conducted in connection with a case filed against her in Gujarat where she is accused of appropriating funds collected for her NGO, which was helping victims of the communal riots in that state. The CBI court, while rejecting their pleas, said that the CBI wanted to recover some important documents from them. \""From the FIR, it appears that the complaint is lodged by deputy secretary, government of India, ministry of home affairs, New Delhi, on the basis of inspection report conducted by team of ministry of home affairs. Offence is non-bailable, serious and required to be investigated,\"" the judge said."""
" The Bombay high court has granted anticipatory bail to Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand. The court rejected the CBI's plea for custodial interrogation of the couple.

But importantly, the judge said that dissent against a government did not amount to dissent against the state. \A dissenting view may be against the policy of the government but it need not be against the sovereignty of the nation,\"" Justice Mridula Bhatkar said, adding that it was the government's duty to protect dissenters.

" The city police, probing the alleged Gulberg Society fund misuse case, today opposed the pleas filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gujarat High Court to de-freeze their their and their two NGOs' bank accounts. Investigating officer of Gulberg Society fund misuse case, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) K N Patel, filed an affidavit in the high court, reiterating their claims that Setalvad and Anand had misused the money, meant for the 2002 Gujarat riots victims, for their personal use. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and their two NGOs Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace had been frozen by the city crime branch last year. The action came soon after it began investigating the case, in which Setalvad allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society into a 2002 riots museum but later utilised that money for personal use. In an affidavit submitted before Justice Sonia Gokani of the high court, Patel said that Setalvad and Anand spent the riot-victims' funds for their personal and luxury uses. Opposing the couple's pleas, the state agency said both of them, as trustees of the two NGos, through diverse methods allegedly misappropriated the funds. \They have misused the funds meant for the rehabilitation and welfare of the unfortunate victims of riots in Gujarat and money collected for construction of the dream museum,\"" stated the affidavit filed by Patel. The agency said that the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulberg society, which was devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of very personal nature have been debited by them. The high court is likely to conduct hearing on the case on August 19. """
" CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury today said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's has become 'Maunendra Modi' due to his \silence\"" over corruption and claimed that agenda of the Monday's all-party meeting, convened to break Parliamentary logjam, was not explained to him by the BJP. The CPI(M) General Secretary blamed the BJP Government for the ongoing impasse in Parliament. The veteran Communist leader accused the Modi government of indulging in \""divisive politics\"" and pursuing \""anti-poor policies\"" which he said have led to drop in living standards of people in the country. The BJP-led government in Maharashtra is following the same policies as pursued by the NDA administration at the Centre, he said while addressing a rally at Azad Maidan in South Mumbai. \""Modi, who earlier boasted of rooting out corruption, is now silent over a series of corruption cases, including Vyapam, and charges against four Deviyan (a reference to Vasundhara Raje, Sushma Swaraj, Pankaja Munde and Smriti Irani), which has resulted in an unprecedented logjam in Parliament,\"" the Rajya Sabha MP maintained. \""Modi has turned into 'Maunendra Modi'. It is his Government, and not us (Opposition), which is holding Parliament to ransom,\"" the 62-year-old leader asserted. \""It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the House functions smoothly. If the Government acts on what we have been suggesting (drop BJP Ministers facing charges), Parliament will function without any hindrance,\"" he said. Yechury said that he got a call to attend an all-party meet convened by the BJP-led Government to break the deadlock in Parliament, but was not specifically told about its agenda. Teesta Setalvad, a social activist whose company is facing charges of receiving funds from abroad in violation of norms, shared the dais with CPI(M) leaders at the rally. Later, speaking to reporters, Yechury accused the NDA Government of \""selectively\"" taking up mercy petitions of death row convicts. This is why 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon was hanged while others were pardoned by the Government. \""Terrorism has no link with religion and it has to be dealt strictly. But there can't be two parameters for delivering justice,\"" said Yechury. The CPI(M) leader was here to launch a 14-day long protest organised by his party in the BJP-ruled states. He accused the BJP governments of being \""anti-poor\"", \""anti- farmers\"" and \""anti-adivasis\"". Accusing the Modi government of practising \""crony capitalism\"", the CPM leader said its economic policies have proved \""disastrous\"" and aggravated the agrarian distress, leading to a significant rise in number of farmer suicides. The Manmohan Singh government's economic policies were \""bad\"", but those followed by the Modi administration were \""worse\"", the Communist leader said."""
" Coming out in support of Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, members of civil society, scholars and media personalities today accused the government of \hounding\"" the two activists for daring to raise their voice against it. Setalvad, who has been working for providing justice to Gujrat riot victims, along with her husband has been facing legal actions for allegedly diverting foreign funds. \""The whole government machinery has been engaged in harassing and intimidating Setalvad and Javed.

" In a breather to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband, the Bombay High Court today granted the duo 17-day interim relief from arrest in a CBI case alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting Teesta and her husband Javed Anand interim protection from arrest till August 10, said the duo was already given protection by the sessions court. Teesta and Anand moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail after a special CBI court today rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas and also refused to extend the interim relief granted to them earlier on July 17. \At this stage I do not want to go into merits. Is there any chance of the accused persons absconding? If no, then interim protection can be granted for a period of two weeks,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. The court directed Teesta and her husband to appear before the office of Economic Offences Wing of CBI on July 27 and 30 and on August 3 and 6 for recording their statement from 12pm to 3pm. The court refused to agree to the CBI's demand to direct the duo to appear before the agency everyday. \""They (Teesta and Javed) have been appearing before you (CBI) from July 17. You must have done some investigation. Everyday appearance is not required,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. Public Prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, appearing for CBI, argued that the offence was of a serious nature and custodial interrogation was required. The court has posted their anticipatory bail petitions for final hearing on August 10. Soon after the sessions court rejected her bail pleas, Teesta told the court that she was shocked and aggrieved. \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic),\"" she said. The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

" Social activist Teesta Setalvad, accused of embezzling funds meant for victims of the Gulberg Housing Society, today rebutted the charges made by Gujarat Police that she and her husband had misappropriated the funds for personal expenses. The statement by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, who are trustees of the two NGOs in question, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust, issued here said the funds raised for the construction of a memorial at Gulberg Society massacre site were still lying unutilised. \Since we, Sabrang Trust only managed to raise Rs 4.6 lakh, we had to inform the Society (members of Gulberg society) that the Memorial project was not feasible,\"" the statement said. \""No contract was ever signed, no property or deed ever changed hands, no rent was promised nor monies changed hands. The Rs 4.6 lakh donated by individuals (all Indians, including one NRI) are still unutilised,\"" it claimed. The statement was issued by Setalvad after Gujarat police filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. Opposing the the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad in the apext court, the state police had alleged that the duo had misappropriated funds that was meant for building a museum at Gulberg Society massacre site, for personal expenses ranging from wine, ear-buds to expensive mobile phone. In the affidavit, the police had said that Setalvad and Anand as trustees of the two trusts -- Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice and Peace (CJP) -- have by \""diverse methods\"" allegedly \""misappropriated funds of charity and converted to their own use funds ment for rehabilitation of riot victims\"".

" Compounding activist Teesta Setalvad's trouble, her NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) has been put under Prior Permission category by the Home Ministry. The decision has been taken following an investigation by the Home Ministry which found alleged violation of various provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act by CJP. \The NGO will have to take prior permission from the foreigners division of the Home Ministry before accepting or utilising the foreign contribution,\"" an official said. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid.

While CJP was registered for 'Educational and Economic' purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as 'Legal Aid' which is covered under purpose 'Social'. Hence, it violated FCRA rules, the Home Ministry contended. \""On review of vouchers of the Association, it was found that Sabrang Trust (another NGO of Teesta) have made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand. \""This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus, the Association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,\"" the Home Ministry notice had said. The Ministry's investigation also found that Anand has taken international medical policy for visiting Lahore and debited the amount in the account of Sabrang Trust. Facing the notices, the two NGOs have conveyed to the Home Ministry that they have done no financial irregularities and no foreign contribution was misused by any of its office bearer. """
" Days after the Central Bureau of Investigation raided activist Teesta Setalvad's Mumbai residence, the Gujarat government filed a fresh affidavit in the Supreme Court seeking permission to arrest her if needed and has urged the court to vacate an earlier order restraining the authorities from doing so.

The state said the couple had refused to cooperate with the investigating agency by not furnishing documents and were tampering with witnesses by inciting auditors not to cooperate. Their failure to furnish documents and entries indicated that they treated the charities as personal property and did not adhere to accounting standards, the state police said. """
" Activists from Gujarat, including a former Gujarat chief minister, extended their support to Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand today, alleging the recent CBI action against her was an \open misuse of power\"" by the Centre. \""We, the undersigned, express our profound dismay and disquiet at the continued official harassment of human rights defenders Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand by the central government,\"" said a statement signed by rights activists from Gujarat, including former Gujarat Chief Minister Suresh Mehta. \""After the BJP-led government was installed in Delhi in May 2014, the country has witnessed open official efforts to foist a large variety of charges of financial irregularities on them, in order to harass them, tarnish their reputations and to secure their arrests,\"" the statement said. \""Fortunately, interventions by the higher judiciary have protected them so far.

" Activist Teesta Setalvad today recorded her statement before the CBI in connection with a case against her firm for allegedly receiving around $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). She had been asked by a local court to appear before the central agency by Tuesday as on Friday special CBI Judge Anis Khan had reserved an order on the anticipatory bail applications filed by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand till tomorrow while granting them interim protection from arrest. The CBI, which registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited, has alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. The CBI sleuths searched four places including premises owned by Setalvad, Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and the office of SCPPL on July 14. The probe agency had opposed the bail plea contending the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected \interference towards the internal security and activities of India\"" and also contested Setalvad's claim that the money received was a fee for consultancy. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation (a US-based NGO) and SCPPL was seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants.

Kodnani was a minister in the Gujarat government under Narendra Modi and Bajrangi is a notorious Hindu right wing activist. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only if it has FCRA registration. The donation was, therefore, a \""serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions, the Home Ministry had said while ordering a CBI probe. A bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, had also been frozen under instructions from the Ministry. The Gujarat government had asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by Setalvad. The Home Ministry had forwarded the complaint to the CBI, which then filed the case after verification. In April, the government had ordered that funds from Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to an Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry. Setalvad and the Gujarat government have been locked in several legal tussles since the post-Godhra riots of 2002.

We are also shocked at the reports of the continual harassment of Shirin Dalvi. Responding to readersβ€™ views, she issued a clarification denying any intention to hurt religious sentiments and tendered a public clarification the very next day. However, cases have beenΒ registeredΒ against her in different police stations in Mumbra and Rabodi (Thane district), Malegaon and Mumbai on charges ofΒ violating Sec 295 of the Indian Penal Code (outraging religious feelings by insulting a religion with malicious intent). While she has sought, and obtained, anticipatory bail in one set of cases from Mumbai Additional Sessions Court judge S D Tekale on January 23, she was arrested in Mumbra, Thane district, andΒ granted bail the same day on Jan 28. The Mumbai based human rights group Hum Azaadiyon Ke Haq Mein is disturbed at theΒ attempts made to defame her character. Baseless statements appeared in several Urdu newspapers that a colleague had tried to dissuade her from using the Charlie Hebdo cover but the colleague identified was actually not even in office on that day and had resigned a few days ago. Other attempts to defame her included statements that she had joined the RSS womenβ€™s wing and was a β€followerβ€™ of Bangladeshi writer in exile Taslima Nasreen! Shirin Dalvi is a respected journalist with more than 20 years of experience in Urdu journalism. She is perhaps the only woman editor in Urdu journalism in India, has written on issues concerning womenβ€™s rights and politics and is well-known for her literary skill and learning. The manner in which she is being hounded bodes ill for free debate and discussionΒ and for peaceful resolution of controversy. Besides, the incident is also being used as a pretext to ratchet up polarized public opinion, which is a dangerous game and detrimental to freedom of speech and expression in a democratic society, besides causing immense personal harm and a threat to her life and safety. We request those who have filed cases against her to accept her clarification in the right spirit with which it has been given and to withdraw all the cases against her.

The court said that \""no further extension can be given... as that would certainly create a bad precedent.\"" In August 2014, an FIR was filed against Setalvad in Ghatlodia police station here by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist for uploading \""objectionable\"" pictures of Hindu deities on Twitter. Setalvad had tweeted a photo-shopped picture of ISIS terrorists with the slain American journalist James Foley against the backdrop of a religious image. She later removed it. She is facing charges under IPC sections 153(a) (promoting enmity between religious groups) and 205(a) (outraging religious feelings) and under IT Act. """

" Government has given a temporary relief to social activist Teesta Setalvad's two NGOs, which allegedly violated Foreign Currency Regulation Act, by allowing them more time to reply to its showcause notices. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notices nearly a month ago following an on-site inspection of their records and books of accounts carried out by Home Ministry officials in April this year. \Even after almost a month, no reply has come from the two NGOs. We have extended the deadline by a fortnight and asked them to reply by mid-July to our showcause notices. If the NGOs do not reply even then, we will have no option but to cancel their FCRA registration,\"" a Home Ministry official said. During the probe under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), Home Ministry officials found that Teesta and her husband were running a magazine \""Communalism Combat\"" as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for 'Educational and Economic' purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as 'Legal Aid' which is covered under purpose 'Social'. Hence, it violated FCRA rules, they contended. \""On review of vouchers of the association, it was found that Sabrang Trust has made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA-designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand. \""This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus, the association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,\"" the Home Ministry notice said. """
" The home ministry is set to cancel the FCRA registration of two NGOs of activist Teesta Setalvad even as it has promised to relax the renewal regime for NGOs in general by making it simpler. The ministry could reduce the number of documents required for the renewal exercise and make the process entirely online. NGOs apply for renewal of their FCRA licence every five years. The ministry plans to reduce the human interface between NGOs and its officials, and make the process online to promote \good\"" NGOs that are following the FCRA regime studiously, a senior home ministry official said, adding that the move will also check corruption. However, the NGOs of Setalvad are expected to face more heat in the days to come. The home ministry has got no reply to the show-cause notices it issued on June 4 to Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice & Peace (CJP) for alleged FCRA violations. The ministry had sought a reply in 15 days. \""If they do not reply soon enough, we will proceed to cancel the FCRA registration of both these NGOs,\"" another home ministry official said. Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had told ET in an interview last week that \""good\"" NGOs should not suffer because of \""bad\"" NGOs. While the former will be protected, promoted and rewarded, the latter need \""to be tamed.\"" """
 The Central Bureau of Investigation has initiated a probe into the alleged violation of Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) rules by a publishing firm owned by social activist Teesta Setalvad. The agency is likely to slap a case against Setalvad in this regard in the next few days, officials said. Setalvad, through her non-governmental organisation, has filed several cases against Gujarat government officials including former chief minister Narendra Modi since the 2002 riots in the state. CBI is probing the allegations that Setalvad's publishing firm Sabrang Communication Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL) accepted a donation of $290,000 and $131,000 from Ford Foundation in violation of FCRA and without getting prior approval from the union home ministry. 
"NEW DELHI: After taking a series of action against \erring\"" NGOs, the Centre is planning to roll out guidelines to help \""genuine\"" voluntary organisations dedicated to welfare of people and society. As per the proposed guidelines, the Home Ministry wants to do away with all physical paper works for NGOs which apply for registration under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). There will be no personal interaction between an applicant and the Home Ministry officials as there have been complaints of corruption at this particular stage. The applicant will have to fill the relevant registration form online and upload documents required at the website of the Home Ministry's foreigners division. \""The process will be simple and less cumbersome as we feel that there are many genuine NGOs who want to do good work,\"" a Home Ministry official said. The renewal process of registration of NGOs in every five year will also be simplified and the organisations will not be \""unnecessary harassed\"" since as per the proposed new rules, the government will get automatic information if any NGO gets foreign donation. The filing of annual returns will be made online and thus check the possibility of the misplacement of papers on transit. The move came after the Home Ministry took a series of action against various NGOs including Greenpeace India, two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and cancelled registration of more than 10,000 NGOs for allegedly violating provisions of the FCRA."""
 Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs - Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch last year, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society to 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case. One of the residents of Gulbarg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan had filed a complaint against Setalwad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulbarg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but it had not been utilised for the purpose. On January 5 last year, an FIR was lodged under IPC Section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, Section 406 (fraud) and Section 420 (cheating) against Setalwad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, chairman of Gulberg society Salim Sandhi and secretary of the society Feroz Gulzar for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore. Yesterday, the Centre had asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by her private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. Government had also frozen the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). On 28 February, 2002, after the Godhra train carnage, 69 people including Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society here during the riots. 
" The home ministry on Friday ordered a CBI probe against activist Teesta Setalvad's company, Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt Ltd for allegedly receiving unauthorised foreign funds and froze a bank account of the company in Mumbai. SCPPL is alleged to have received a donation of Rs 1.83 cr and Rs 1.31 cr from the US-based Ford Foundation without a Foreign Contribution Regulation Act license, the ministry said. \SCPPL is a private limited company engaged in publications which is not entrusted to receive foreign contribution. If the company thought otherwise, they could have applied for prior nod before accepting foreign donations,\"" the MHA order said.  """
" The government may ask CBI to probe alleged transfer of funds by the Ford Foundation to activist Teesta Setalvad's Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL). Official sources said SCPPL had accepted a grant of USD 2.9 lakh from the Ford Foundation despite being a private company not having clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). This donation was, therefore, a serious violation of FCRA provisions, which mandate funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration, they said. The sources claimed the Home Ministry during its inspection of the company's accounts found that an amount of Rs 50 lakh was allegedly transferred to it by Setalvad's Sabrang Trust which also was in violation of FCRA norms. Gujarat government had asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. The fund transfer from Ford Foundation, at present, has to be cleared by a nodal official in the Home Ministry. In April, the government had ordered that funds from the Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry. The Gujarat government and Setalvad are embroiled in legal battles. While she has filed several cases against the state government functionaries including the then chief minister Narendra Modi in connection with the communal riots of 2002, the state police has filed a case of embezzlement of funds against her. The Gujarat police has been probing a case of alleged embezzlement of Rs 1.51 crore against Setalvad, based on a complaint by survivors of Gulberg Society. Setalvad, in her statement earlier, had said that Sabrang Trust had co-operated with the Home Ministry team which visited its offices. Her anticipatory bail plea is pending before the Supreme Court after the Gujarat High Court rejected her pre-arrest bail plea. """

" Supreme Court Bar Association president Dushyant Dave on Wednesday questioned the top court's decision to grant bail to all accused in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, and also former Gujarat minister Maya Kodnani, who was convicted for the murder of 70 people during the 2002 Gujarat riots. A bench comprising Justices JS Khehar, Jasti Chelameswar, Madan B Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel is hearing petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the National Judicial Commission Act (NJAC), which they claim will erode judicial independence. Dave was responding to Justice Kurian Joseph's contention that if the collegium system had not worked, a part of the blame lay with the government for not doing its due diligence on a candidate's integrity. Continuing his arguments in support of the NJAC, Dave rejected Justice Kurian's suggestion saying that every government would want pliable judges. \The executive wants a weak, pliable judiciary. Lack of integrity suits the executive, which knows how to manipulate them,\"" he said. Dave then turned to how the collegium had failed in choosing the best in \""ethical behavior and personal conduct\"". Throwing his weight behind the NJAC, he said that the system of selection did not matter as long as the person had integrity and was not amenable after he was made a judge. He, however, faulted the top court for failing to address the concerns of civil society and that of ordinary citizens. \""Every accused in the Sohrabuddin case gets bail, but poor Teesta (activist Teesta Setalvad) has to run from pillar to post. In all the Gujarat riot cases, those accused of murder get acquitted. The state does not appeal. This court gave bail to Maya Kodnani who was convicted for the murder of 70 people.\"" Dave also accused the court of failing to come to the rescue of activists such as Setalvad and Prashant Bhushan. \""Democracy needs such activists. The court needs to protect them.\"" He credited Bhushan for drawing attention to the 2G and coal scams, which had garnered over Rs 2 lakh crore for the exchequer. Bhushan does not demand z-plus security or 68 security personnel like Baba Ramdev, he said. All this would have to be kept in mind during selection of a judge, he said. \""Once when a man gets power, will he be amenable to power or will he remember his oath?\"" Justice Joseph sought to know if the NJAC would guarantee this. Dave said there can be no guarantees, but at least there will be consultations and transparency, which were an improvement over the collegium system. \""Any inroad into judicial independence has to be serious, not imaginary,\"" he said.

WHAT ABOUT JUSTICE TO 17 MUSLIMS BURNT ALIVE ON 6 DECEMBER, 1992? admin on August 2, 2015 at 1:32 AM 0 Shares By Sandeep Pandey YakubMemon has been hanged for his role in the 1993 serial bomb blasts in Mumbai in which 257 people were killed. Relatives of some of the victims and survivors claim that justice has been done even though a number of people, including a former intelligence officer, late B. Raman, thought that it was not justified to hang YakubMemon. Yakub had cooperated in the investigation after his arrest. But it was necessary to hang Yakub, just like it was necessary to hang Afzal Guru, to make the nation feel that justice had been done in the wrong committed by these individuals. Imagine, if Afzal or Yakub were not hanged. There would have been a feeling persisted that the government could not take to task people who were involved in such big incidents of terror in the country. India would have appeared as a weak or even a meek country. Is it not a travesty that the Hindu majority, which believes itself to be peaceful community, rejoices the public hanging of culprits, especially Muslims, to satisfy itself that justice is being done without even questioning whether the right people are being hanged? In the case of both Afzal Guru and YakubMemon, the role of individuals was marginal in the crimes for which they were executed, leaving behind suffering families. Inadvertent result of these capital punishments has been that the real culprits for the serious crimes have been let off. There is strong reaction by Indians to incidents of terror inflicted upon us which have origin in Pakistan which is quite justified. The majority also complains about the treatment Hindus are meted out in Pakistan. Infiltration from Bangladesh is considered undesirable but Hindus from Pakistan are happily given refuge here. But there is not even a murmur about the brutal massacre of Hindu Tamils by the Sinhalese government which took place in Sri Lanka some years ago. Is the Hindu majority Indian society biased towards Muslims and Islamic nations? The Mumbai serial blasts were planned as a reaction to the demolition of Babri Masjid on 6 December, 1992. In fact, in a number of bomb blast incidents which, after the 11 September, 2001 attack on US, came to be called β€terroristβ€™ attacks, the youth involved confessed that they were motivated to undertake these operations as a revenge for Babri Masjid demolition. Hence Babri Masjid demolition can be described as the mother of most terrorist incidents in India. The pertinent question to be asked is if people are being punished for their involvement in incidents which happened as a reaction to Babri Masjid demolition, when will the perpetrators of Babri Masjid demolition be punished? Moreover, on 6 December, 1992, in the frenzy created as a result of demolition of the Babri Masjid, 17 Muslims were torched alive in Ayodhya. Complaints were given to the police but no FIR has been lodged till date. When will we think about the justice which needs to be done to the families of the burnt victims? The role of Hindutva organizations has been established in at least five terrorist incidents around the country. The country is waiting to see what treatment will be meted out to culprits in these cases if they are convicted? Indian government, judiciary as well as people have to prove that they donβ€™t apply different standards when dealing with Muslims. As a civilized country and especially if the Hindu majority considers itself a torch bearer of peace then the barbaric act of death penalty must be abolished. 103 countries in the world have abolished death penalty completely and 6 have done it for ordinary crimes. The UN General Assembly has passed resolutions five times calling for global moratorium on executions. In India a number of people die in fake encounters, judicial custody or at police stations. India needs to improve its record so far as legal and illegal killings by the state are concerned. The present central governmentβ€™s anti-minority bias is also reflected in the hounding of Teesta Setalvad by CBI whose organization Citizens for Justice and Peace fought legal cases for victims of 2002 violence in Gujarat. CJP is also a co-petitioner along with Zakia Jafri, wife of former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri who was publicly killed in 2002, which sought a criminal trial of the then CM of Gujarat Narendra Modi, the current PM of the country, along with other politicians and officials for their role in the riots. This is the only case in which NarendraModi has been named and that explains why CBI is being used to harass Teesta by the present dispensation headed by him. Teesta Setalvad has played an important role in the conviction of 120 culprits for their complicity in 2002 riots who have now been sentenced to life imprisonment. They include a former minister in NarendraModiβ€™s Gujarat government, Dr. Maya Kodnani and a prominent Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi. Kodnani, then a MLA, and Bajrangi were found guilty of murder as they led a mob which killed 97 Muslims in Naroda Patiya. Both are leniently given bail even after conviction whereas hundreds of Muslim youth accused in various terrorist incidents continue to languish in jails as trails procrastinate. If India is to be recognized as a truly democratic nation which treats all its citizens equal before the law then the communal bias in our system must go. The state machinery must not be used to hound minorities and judiciary must be fair. Human rights activists fighting for the right of people who are being discriminated against must be held honourably instead of being harassed. The citizenry must evolve and mature. The highest value in democracy, justice, must be held highly by all. Discussion Categories Edit/Op-Ed Author admin Website Place your ad here Loading...

Replying another question, the Minister said in 2014, penalty of Rs 51.99 lakh was imposed on 24 NGOs for receiving and utilising foreign contribution without registration or prior permission. Till date, 30 cases of violation involving misappropriation or misutilisation of foreign contribution have been referred to CBI of which six cases resulted in conviction. Ten cases of violation involving mis-appropriation of foreign contribution have been referred to the concerned state police and accounts of 34 associations have been frozen for violation of various provisions of FCRA. A total of 69 NGOs have been prohibited from receiving foreign contribution, 16 foreign donor agencies have been placed under prior permission category. \""Registration of 10,117 associations has been cancelled for not filing the annual returns continuously for three years and even not responding to show cause notices issued,\"" he said.

Transfer of foreign contribution to unregistered NGOs, utilisation of foreign contribution amount for the purposes different from the grant of different from the objectives of the recipient NGO, registration of assets are some of the other reasons of taking action against NGOs.

" US-based Ford Foundation has funded a political party and profit making organisations \illegally\"" which has resulted in the foreign outfit coming under the Home Ministry scanner and put on the \""watch list\"". A senior Home Ministry official said an investigation has found that funds sanctioned by the Ford Foundation to an NGO have reached a political party which automatically makes the donor liable to face action. But the Ford Foundation has rejected the charge. The probe has also found that Ford Foundation has funded several organisations which do not fall in the category of NGOs, which are eligible for receiving foreign funds, as they make profits, the official said. The international donor strongly refuted the charge of funding political parties but accepted that it worked with various entities including those which work for profits. \""We wish to affirm that the foundation does not fund political parties. The foundation does, however, work with a range of other entities, including non-governmental organisations, government and quasi-government entities, universities, and for-profit entities, depending on the needs of the particular work involved. \""This includes engaging for-profit entities to provide services to the foundation and its grantee communities,\"" Ford Foundation spokesperson Joshua Cinelli told PTI in a statement. Under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, no donor can fund political parties or any organisation which makes profits. Following the investigation, the Home Ministry has put the Ford Foundation on its \""watch list\"" and ordered that all funds coming from the US-based donor have to be routed only with its nod due to \""national security concerns\"". The Reserve Bank of India has been requested to instruct all the banks and their branches to ensure that any fund flow from Ford Foundation to any person, NGO or organisation in India should be brought to the notice of the Home Ministry so that funds are allowed to be credited into the accounts of the recipient only after clearance of the Ministry. The Home Ministry has also found that Ford Foundation has given funds to at least six NGOs which were not registered under the FCRA, making the payment \""illegal\"", the official said. The Ford Foundation said it would continue to respond fully to official queries directed to it but was yet to hear directly from the Home Ministry. \""Our aim is to work closely with government partners to clarify any area of question or concern. If the Government suggests methods by which we can strengthen and improve our grant-making processes, we will take swift and appropriate steps to incorporate them. \""We are confident in our work and compliance with law and look forward to a constructive outcome. Most importantly, we appreciate the privilege of supporting the people of India and look forward to continuing to do so,\"" Ford Foundation said. Interestingly, Gujarat government had recently asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. The action against Ford Foundation came weeks after the Home Ministry froze seven bank accounts of Greenpeace India and barred it from receiving foreign funds for allegedly violating FCRA and \""prejudicially\"" affecting the country's public and economic interests."""
" The United States has expressed concern over India's crackdown on Ford Foundation and Greenpeace, and said it is seeking \clarification\"" on the action. \""We are aware that the (Indian) ministry of home affairs suspended the registration of Greenpeace India and has placed the Ford Foundation on a prior permission watch list,\"" the state department deputy acting spokesperson, Marie Harf, told reporters at her daily news conference. \""We remain concerned about the difficulties caused to civil society organizations by the manner in which the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act has been applied,\"" she said in response to a question. \""We are concerned that this recent ruling limits the necessary and critical debate within Indian society and we are seeking a clarification on this issue with the appropriate Indian authorities,\"" Harf said. In a crackdown on foreign fundings to NGOs, the Union home ministry has put the Ford Foundation of the US on its \""watch list\"" and ordered that all funds coming from the international organization have to be routed only with its nod due to \""national security concerns\"". The home ministry said it has decided to keep a watch on all activities funded by Ford Foundation and by exercising the powers conferred under Section 46 of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act 2010, directed Reserve Bank of India to ensure that funds coming from it be brought to the notice of the home ministry. The ministry said it wanted to ensure that funds coming from Ford Foundation is utilised for \""bonafide welfare activities without compromising on concerns of national interest and security\"". The move came after Gujarat government asked the home ministry to take action against Ford Foundation as it alleged that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in the internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. Early this month, the home ministry had frozen seven bank accounts of Greenpeace India and barred it from receiving foreign funds for allegedly violating FCRA and \""prejudicially\"" affecting the country's public and economic interests. """
" The government on Thursday placed the Ford Foundation, one of the world's most high-profile private funding agencies, on the 'prior permission' list. This means that all its funds coming into India will first have to be scrutinised and cleared by the home ministry. An order issued by the home ministry cited \national interest and security\"" as the reason for placing the USbased Foundation on a watch list. The order signed by Home Ministry Undersecretary Anand Joshi directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to instruct all banks to ensure that \""any fund flow from Ford Foundation\"" is referred to the ministry and allowed only after its clearance. Home ministry spokesperson KS Dhatwalia confirmed the development. Coming on the heels of the clampdown on Greenpeace, this will strengthen the perception of social activists that the NDA government wants to adopt a hard line toward NGOs. The Foundation was allegedly funding NGOs that were not registered under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act or FCRA. \""Among the violations noticed, it was found that the Ford Foundation had been involved in funding non-FCRA registered entities which amounts to serious violation of the FCRA 2010 law,\"" the home ministry spokesperson said. The Ford Foundation is on the watch list based on inputs received from security agencies, he said. \""This does not prevent Ford Foundation from contributing money to FCRA-registered associations. Our main concern is Ford Foundation contributing money to non-FCRA registered associations. So each and every contribution will have to be intimated to the home ministry and if the contribution is valid and in order for a FCRA-registered organisation, it will be immediately cleared,\"" the home ministry spokesperson told ET. Ford Foundation, in a written response to ET, said it was only aware of a review in view of the home ministry's ongoing investigations. \""In light of recent communication from the ministry of finance, our nodal ministry in the government of India, the Ford Foundation has officially learned that the ministry of home affairs is reviewing information related to their ongoing investigation of Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt. Ltd,\"" a spokesperson said. ET had reported on April 18 that the government was examining some of Ford Foundation's activities. UNDER I-B SCANNER The funding agency had been under Intelligence Bureau (IB) scrutiny for the past one year and grants worth $5 million given by it had been blocked by the Indian government amid suspicion that it was funding organisations and NGOs that were working against the perceived national interest. The Gujarat government had also complained to the home ministry against the Foundation on the grounds that it was interfering with the judicial system of the country and working against communal harmony. This was part of the state's complaint against Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand, activists who have been seeking justice for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The organisations that the couple run β€” Sabrang Trust and Sabrang Communications have received payments from the agency as grants and consultation fees. Some officials said the Ford Foundation had not been filing income-tax (I-T) returns. \""The agency is not registered as either a NGO under the Societies Act or under the Companies Act or even the Trusts Act. It only had permission of RBI to run a branch office in India, which was routing funds amounting to Rs 100 crore every year in violation of I-T laws,\"" an official belonging to the security establishment told ET. Civil right activists Nikhil Dey and Harsh Mander told ET that they failed to understand government's concerns with regard to agencies such as the Ford Foundation and Greenpeace. \""In these days of neo-liberal globalisation, the Prime Minister goes all over the world looking for funding -- FDI (foreign direct investment) and from corporates. The crackdown against NGOs through funds is actually a desire of the government to push for certain policies,\"" Dey said. According to him, the government action against funding agencies did not reflect due process of law. \""I am surprised and also puzzled that the government has acted against the Ford Foundation, which is the biggest ever international funding agency. It seems that by taking action against the big ones, the government is putting the fear of God in the other NGOs and funding agencies,\"" Dey said. However, he added that the tendency to curb dissent by acting against NGOs was not peculiar to the BJP-led government. \""Even the Manmohan Singh government had tried to suppress the NGO sector, especially those protesting against nuclear plants and GM crops. But this government has taken it to extremes,\"" Dey said. Mander felt that action against the Foundation was mainly because of its funding of Teesta Setalvad's work. He said that the suspicion of \""foreign funding, that it was used to foment dissent, belonged to an earlier era when Indira Gandhi feared the CIA hand in everything.\"" According to him, the time had come to evolve a transparent, ethical and accountable system of funding - whether from abroad or domestic."""
 The Supreme Court today decided to hear in July the anticipatory bail plea of Teesta Setalvad and her husband in the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. The matter, which was listed for fresh hearing today, did not reach the board, but when the bench was about to rise for the day, Gujarat government said it wanted to file an affidavit indicating the progress made into the investigation. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani made the mention saying there was a need to file affidavit as certain material during the course of investigation allegedly revealed gross misuse of funds by Setalvad. He asked a new bench comprising Justices A R Dave, V Gopala Gowda and C Nagappan to hear it after a week but senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Dushyant Dave, appearing for Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, sought time to file reply. Senior advocate Dave expressed his inability to argue the matter in May as he would be out of the country. The bench then said the matter will be heard in the second week of July. The apex court had on April 16 constituted a three-judge bench to hear afresh the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband as a two-judge bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel on March 19 had referred it to the larger bench and had extended its interim order protecting them against arrest till the larger bench takes up the matter. 
" The Ford Foundation, no stranger to controversy for supporting liberal causes around the world, may find itself at the receiving end of some tough questions in India. The government is looking askance at some of its activities, which include giving money to organisations that are perceived to be working against the public interest, according to officials. About $5 million in grants by the Ford Foundation, arguably the biggest such international funding agency, have been blocked by the Indian government in the past few months, top officials told ET on condition of anonymity. The ostensible reason is that the recipient non-governmental organisations (NGOs) haven't filed annual reports and balance sheets with the home ministry. This also includes about $100,000 in grants to the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS). \Action against Ford Foundation is under consideration and likely to be taken soon,\"" said one official. \""It is expected that full procedure and due process, similar to the action against Greenpeace, is under consideration.\"" The Narendra Modi government has suspended the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, or FCRA, licence that allows Greenpeace India to get funds from overseas. The suspension of Greenpeace's FCRA licence came after the government prevented a member of the organisation from travelling to the UK to speak to lawmakers there about the rights of indigenous communities. NGOs have been on their guard after a leaked 2014 Intelligence Bureau report said such organisations were creating hurdles to development. Greenpeace International has accused the government of harassment. The government is examining how the Ford Foundation grants are being utilised, said the person cited above. The Ford Foundation doesn't see anything unusual in the time being taken for grant authorisation. \""Regarding government approvals of Ford Foundation grants in India, this process has been in place for decades, and in our experience it is not unusual for these thoughtful approvals to take some time,\"" a spokesperson said in an email. \""All our work with organisations in India is transparent and readily available on our website. The online grants database goes back to 2006, and prior to that our work is listed in our annual reports.\"" The home ministry didn't respond to questions. To be sure, the foundation has been on the radar of Indian intelligence agencies for decades, on account of which the finance ministry was mandated to clear each grant that it made to NGOs. This scrutiny intensified after it became known that the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement of 2011 got a boost from the foundation with Arvind Kejriwal's NGO Kabir getting about $400,000. Kabir didn't respond to queries. COMPLAINT FROM GUJARAT Home ministry officials cited the Gujarat government's complaint that the foundation is interfering with the judicial system of the country and working against communal harmony. This is part of Gujarat's complaint against Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand, activists who have been seeking justice for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The organisations that the couple run β€” Sabrang Trust and Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd β€” have received payments from the Ford Foundation. The trust received $250,000 between 2009 and 2013 by way of grants while Sabrang Communication has been paid consultancy fees, Anand said. AGujarat Crime Investigation Department (CID) report said the funds were used for what it called \""highly questionable activities... all bordering on if not outright political\"". The funds were used to keep \""the 2002 riots issue alive in public memory\"" and to fund litigation. Gujarat has asked for investigations into possible FCRA violations by the foundation. It also wanted the home ministry to examine the funding of Sabrang Trust and another linked NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP). The Gujarat government also said the NGOs functioned as proxy offices for the Ford Foundation. Anand refuted the allegations. \""Sabrang Trust did not engage in filing any case in any court or use Ford Foundation grant for the purpose,\"" he said in an email. \""Legal aid to ensure justice to the victims of communal mass crimes (including Gujarat 2002) was and remains an activity of Citizens for Justice and Peace. CJP has never received any grant from Ford Foundation.\"" Β  FOUNDATION AWARE OF INQUIRY The Gujarat CID also said the foundation had asked Sabrang to \""identify 100 journalists in the print and electronic, English and vernacular media to supply them with material for their stories\"". This was entirely legitimate and didn't constitute political interference in any manner, Anand said."""
" The Supreme Court has constituted a three-judge bench to hear afresh the anticipatory bail plea of Teesta Setalvad and her husband in the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. The apex court registry issued a notice listing the matter for hearing on April 21 before the three-judge bench. However, the names of the judges sitting in the bench will be known later. The anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand would be heard afresh as a two-judge bench on March 19 had referred it to the larger bench and had extended its interim order protecting them against arrest till the larger bench takes up the matter. A bench comprising Justice Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel had said the larger bench will have to consider as to whether a person can be granted anticipatory bail when issues like liberty and fair and effective probe are to be decided simultaneously. The couple has challenged the Gujarat High Court February 12 order denying them anticipatory bail. Hours after the High Court verdict, they had rushed to the apex court which had stayed the order for a day and later on February 13, a bench of Justices S J Mukhopadhya (Since retired) and N V Ramana extended the interim order till February 19. However, a controversy cropped up a day before the hearing, when the matter was referred to a new bench of Justices Misra and Goel as there was no reason assigned by the apex court registry for the change of the bench. After reserving for a month, the bench headed by Justice Misra referred the matter to a larger bench by noting that the interim order of February 12, 13 and March 19 on the stay of High Court order would continue till the case is taken up.

As a result, people who were in the margins have become more marginalized. After 1991, he said, changes in the economy have changed the nature of every institution. Earlier the responsibility of an individual was on the state and society but after the dominance of the market, each individual is left to themselves to solve their own troubles. The market looks at individuals only as economic beings and consumers. Market has no moral concerns. It is advancing techniques while leaving behind society.

" Accusing the BJP government at the Centre as one being \run\"" by RSS, social activist Teesta Setalvad today alleged that issues like \""Sanskritisation\"" were part of a process to change India into a Hindu state. \""I believe the government at the Centre is run by RSS. It is an RSS government. You are confused, I am not confused at all,\"" she told reporters here. On Hindutva and Sanskritisation \""pursued\"" by BJP, she alleged it was a process of political motive to change the character of the Indian state to a majoritarian Hindu one and implement the agenda first through Home, Education and Culture Ministries. \""Regardless of whatever has been stated in the name of development, the government agenda is run by RSS.\"" She referred to a 1999 meet chaired by then Union Minister Murli Manohar Joshi, saying it was boycotted by even NDA allies like Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP on Sanskritisation. Stressing that a process has been on since then, she said each time this government came to power, their agenda was on the \""question of culture and education\"" and to push it. \""Today you have a brute majority government and quite naturally this agenda will be taken forward much more aggressively and it is being taken forward.\"" A \""talk was on\"" that the HRD Ministry was looking to push books of RSS ideologue Dina Nath Batra all over the country through the CBSE, she claimed and added that these books were already reaching about four lakh students in Gujarat. Asked if she would move court on the issue, Teesta said \""there is constant discussion among us on whether you can go to court on policy matters or build resistance otherwise.\"" On attacks on worship places in Northern India, she said these could not have happened without vilification campaign against Christians and conversions. \""Whether it was the attack on nun in West Bengal or Churches in Delhi it happens because of a systematic campaign built about Christians, Muslims and Dalits and it allows social sanction for violence.\"" Referring to BJP MP Adityanath, she said he should have been disqualified from Parliament 10 years ago. \""You have Parliamentarians indulging in most filthy kind of speech.\"" On communal polarisation vis-a-vis the social media, she said \""you see certain pattern trolling in Twitter and Facebook and it is not spontaneous.\"" There is \""huge money\"" being spent in creating a mood in social media which was not spontaneous, she said and added that there was a \""deliberate attempt to polarise and provoke.\"" She expressed solidarity with Tamil writers like Perumal Murugan who were targeted by some caste groups and supporters of RSS for \""offensive content.\"" On the importance of supporting survivors of communal violence, she alleged \""the attempt by the regime in power in Delhi and Gujarat is to actually remove us from the scene so that we don't give help to survivors and so that their testimonies are not protected in court.\"""""
" A larger bench of the Supreme Court will now weigh whether activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand should be subject to custodial interrogation or released on anticipatory bail over allegations that funds of two NGOs run by them for people affected in the 2002 Gujarat riots were misused. A two-judge bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel referred the issue of whether the duo's liberty should trump fair and effective probe to a larger bench and extended an earlier order restraining Gujarat police from arresting them for an indefinite period. \Liberty is a precious value in a civil society, the bench noted, but so is rule of law. No one is above the law. However, the issue of whether the couple should be interrogated in custody for offences of criminal breach of trust, forgery and cheating was a seminal question,\"" the bench said.

" The Supreme Court today referred to a larger bench the petition filed by Teesta Setalvad and her husband seeking anticipatory bail in the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots.

While referring the matter to a larger bench, a bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the matter in hand raises several issues pertaining to concept of liberty in view of the offences enumerated in the case. The bench also said that among the issues that needed to be discussed included supremacy of law, value of liberty, concept of regulated liberty, anticipatory bail and issue of non-cooperation during investigation by the accused. The two-judge bench had on February 19 reserved its order in the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband who had challenged the Gujarat High Court order denying them the relief. The High Court in its February 12 judgement had observed that Setalvad and her husband were not cooperating in the probe and that \they cannot be armoured with full-fledged anticipatory bail when applicants did not cooperate with the investigation\"". Hours after the High Court had denied them the bail, they had moved the apex court and the bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu had granted stay of the order and posted the matter for next day. A bench of justices S J Mukhopadhya (since retired)and N V Ramana had asked some tough questions to Setalvad and her husband for seeking anticipatory bail. It had extended the protection from arrest till February 19 when a new bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel further extended the stay and reserved the judgement. Setalvad and her husband have been booked by the Crime Branch of Gujarat Police on charges of cheating, breach of trust and under the IT Act, in a matter relating to the construction of \""Museum of Resistance\"" in the Gulbarg Society in Ahmedabad which was hit by communal riots in 2002. The bench headed by Justice Misra had clarified that non-cooperation by Teesta a social activist, and her husband into the investigation would give liberty to Gujarat police to move application for cancellation of bail. It had also directed the accused to hand over the list of documents sought from them by the Gujarat police to carry forward its investigation into the case. On February 28, 2002, in the aftermath of the Godhra train burning incident, armed rioters had swooped on the Gulbarg Society and killed 69 people, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri. One of the riot victims from Gulbarg Housing Society, which was burnt during the 2002 post-Godhra riots, had lodged a complaint with the Ahmedabad Police against Setalvad, Anand and two NGOs run by them - Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust - alleging misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 1.51 crore. According to the complaint, the accused persons had collected funds in the name of converting part of the Gulbarg Society into a museum and had allegedly misappropriated funds worth Rs 1.51 crore. The accused had contended that they have been implicated in the case and were victims of political vendetta. They claimed that they were being targeted by the perpetrators of the riots. In 2006, the social activists decided to build the 'Museum of Resistance' at the site of the Gulbarg Society. Accordingly in 2009, a part of the plot was sold to Sabrang Trust. However in 2012, the idea of the museum was dropped as the prices escalated. The same was communicated to the society.

In a focused fusillade at the arch-rival, Sonia said Modi was repackaging the UPA schemes for political credit but suppressing unpalatable truth like the 'rapid survey of child health' which has exposed the PM as failure as chief minister (of Gujarat) in the field of child health. \""The survey showed Gujarat in poor light and on various child nutrition and health indicators, the state was well below the national average,\"" she said, contrasting it with the record of UPA which was shown to have brought down child malnutrition appreciably. \""The PM has turned out to be a master re-packager, a skilful salesman, a sharp headline-grabber and a clever news manager... what is positively deplorable is the shocking cuts in the budgetary allocations for these social sector schemes,\"" she said. In contrast, Sonia questioned the government's charge that Congress was dividing the country on terrorism by stalling Parliament in the wake of Gurdaspur terror strike. Recalling \""those terrible days\"" of 26/11 Mumbai attacks, Sonia said, \""The then CM of Gujarat arrived in the city on November 28, 2008, and chose to be critical of PM Manmohan Singh while the anti-terror operations were underway. And we are now being accused of not showing statesmanship.\"" She said Congress was not stalling parliament to match BJP's past aggression but protesting the government's brazen attitude which was using its numerical strength as a \""source of arrogance\"" rather than responsibility. Sonia criticized government curbs on NGOs \""which are integral to our democracy and many serve as the moral conscience of our society\"". In what appeared an allusion to Teesta Setalvad, she said some NGOs were facing vendetta \""for exposing the dark deeds of those in power\"". The Congress chief accused the Centre of \""anti-farmer policies\"" which have \""crippled rural India\"". She said government was not providing support price while doors were opened for largescale import of wheat. \""Does 'Make in India' not apply to our kisans,\"" she asked. She said the HRD Ministry had been \""mortgaged to a certain ideology\"" which should be of concern to the country, particularly the youth \""whose future is being endangered by communalism and mediocrity in learning and culture\""."""
" The HRD Ministry has set up a committee to probe alleged misappropriation of funds received under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan by an NGO run by activist Teesta Setalvad, who is facing heat along with her husband in a separate case of embezzlement. The three-member committee is to be headed by Supreme Court lawyer Abhijit Bhattacharjee and comprise Gujarat Central University Vice Chancellor SA Bari and senior HR Ministry official Gaya Prasad as its members. The panel will look into allegations against the NGO Sabrang Trust based on a complaint received by the ministry about \mis-utilisation\"" of funds by it, officials in the HRD Ministry said, confirming the setting up of the committee. The two members of the committee, however, said they were yet to receive any communication in this regard. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand are also involved in the Gulbarg society embezzlement case. Supreme Court recently directed Gujarat Police not to arrest the duo in the case while asking them to cooperate in the probe. The case pertains to funds for a museum in Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society, which was devastated in the 2002 riots. Meanwhile, sources in the ministry said that Setalvad could also be dropped from the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), which is being reconstituted after NDA government came to power. CABE is the highest decision-making body on education in the country. """
 The Supreme Court today asked Gujarat Police to give social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband the list of documents needed from them in the probe against them in a case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. A Bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the accused are also entitled to have the list which the state police has already provided to the apex court. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Setalvad, mentioned the issue saying that the couple has not received the list, the report of which has been in a section of media. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat Government, said the list was not handed over to them as there was a likelihood of them filing some application. The bench had on February 19 provided protection to Setalvad and Javed Anand and while reserving the judgement on their anticipatory bail directed the couple to supply to investigators all all documents, vouchers, list of donors in the two NGOs -- Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace -- run by them. It was alleged by Gujarat Police that funds of the NGOs were allgedly used for personal purpose by them, a charge denied by Setalvad. Gujarat Police on February 20 had provided to the apex court a list of documents, including those related to personal expenditure of Setalvad and her husband, it needed in its probe against them in a case. Among other important documents, investigators have sought a list of donors, both foreign and local to their two NGOs along with the date of donation and the amount and their addresses and contact numbers since 2007 till date. The Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, had placed a list of 33 documents like copies of all credit card bills held and used by Setalvad and Javed Anand from April 2008 to December 2014 along with the statement of payments made towards these credit card bills from their personal accounts with supporting vouchers/document. The police have also sought statement disclosing which items in the bills of the credit cards pertain to personal expenditure of the couple and those made in connection with the trust. Among other documents, the investigators have demanded vouchers/invoices in respect of the items of expenditure in credit cards bills which were claimed to have been incurred in connection with the object of the trust. Further, the police had sought documents which will provide details regarding nature of business from which income has been earned as per the income tax returns filed by Setalvad and her husband under the heading business income. Details of all gifts made to them from April 2008 to March 2014 by parents as well as by other donors have been sought by police which want to know whether they were made by cheque or cash with the identities and addresses of persons. Other documents relate to the banks and account books and list of every donor foreign and local to Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt. Ltd. from October 2007 till date, with their addresses and contact numbers. Police have also sought documents to verify details of cash donations received with names of donors and its utilization and all bank account details, current and savings, of Sabrang Trust and CJP from 2007 onwards till date along with vouchers and invoices.
" Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh today accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to occupy the \centrestage\"" of the Congress party with his talk on tolerance and right of minorities, and asked whether \""a leopard ever changes its spots.\"" \""Today the definition of secularism is being challenged. What does secularism mean to us. It means 'sarva dharma sambhav' (equality of all religions). And now, Prime Minister Modi is trying to occupy the centrestage of the Congress party. Can a leopard ever change its spots. It cannot,\"" Singh claimed. \""Mr Modi is now talking of tolerance. He is talking of the right of minorities,\"" he said, at an event to observe the 125th birth anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru here. Attacking Modi for being \""communal\"", Singh asked whether he feels sorry for the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, or provide justice to those affected by it. \""I would like to ask him. Is he repenting that thousands of innocent people were killed in Gujarat riots? Is he prepared to give justice to those who suffered in 2002 riots? These are the issues Modi should first address,\"" he said. Singh also asked Modi whether he is ready to take action against a BJP leader accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots or drop a Union minister for her \""Ramzada and ... remarks\"", which divided the nation. \""Is he ready to take action against BJP leader ( Suresh Rana), who is accused in Muzzafarnagar riots. Is he prepared drop a minister (Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti) who divided the whole country into Ramzada and...\"" he said. Singh asked Modi to first act instead of talking on the issue of protecting the interests of minorities. \""If he is serious about keeping the country together, and if he is serious about looking into the interest of minorities, he first must act. Only words will not make a difference.\"" He alleged that officers, who investigated false police encounters are being \""harassed\"" and activists like Teesta Setalvad who fought for secularism are being \""hounded\"". \""The officers who investigated false police encounters are being harassed. Is this justice? Famous activists (Teesta) Setalvad who fought for justice for people affected by Gujrat riots is being hounded.

" The Supreme Court on Thursday directed that activist Teesta Setalvad and husband Javed Anand should not be arrested for now in connection with charges by the Gujarat police over alleged embezzlement of funds meant for victims of the 2002 religious violence in the state. The bench also directed the couple, accused of making personal use of over Rs 1 crore received as donations by two trusts for the riot victims, to cooperate with the investigation. The bench comprising justices Dipak Misra and AM Sapre said it would pass a detailed order later on Setalvad's anticipatory bail plea in which it would permit the state to demand cancellation of bail if she didn't cooperate with the investigation. SC observed it could understand the state police's insistence on custodial interrogation if the matter pertained to a \great scam\"". \""...but not a trust, an NGO which gets money from donations. If auditing is bad, it is bad. Therefore, why should they be taken into custody and interrogated?\"" The original bench of SC hearing the plea was unexpectedly changed on Wednesday, with no explanation being given. Appearing for the state police, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani said custodial interrogation was necessary on the grounds of non-cooperation and tampering with witnesses. He, however, dropped charges under Section 468 (forgery), Section 420 (cheating) and Section 72 of the IT Act that had been invoked during arguments. That left charges under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust) and Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy). Setalvad has said the allegations are part of a witch hunt against her for espousing the cause of the Gujarat riot victims. Jethmalani said \""the conspiracy began in 2007 when NGOs through an ad blitzkrieg received over Rs 8 crore in the name of the victims. We are only asking for accounts.\"" All the answers given by them were stock replies, he said. This prompted justice Misra to wonder if the state expected Setalvad to implicate herself. That is not permitted under the Constitution, he said. \""That will be a confession to police. You expect them to say that?\"" Trust money was used to make credit card payments for personal items like hairdressers, wine, branded clothes and shoes, Jethmalani said. Setalvad's lawyer Kapil Sibal denied any use of trust funds for personal expenses. Justice Misra then ruled against her arrest. \""It is a question of misappropriation, embezzlement or accounting. Not a case for custodial interrogation.\"" """
 The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that social activist Teesta Setalvad will not be arrested in connection with a case of alleged embezzlement of NGO funds. The case had been filed against her by the Gujarat government in 2014. Setalvad, who claims that the case was politically motivated, was, however, asked to cooperate with the investigations into the case. The state government claims that the activist misappropriated over Rs 1 crore raised for riot victims. Setalvad has denied the charge. A bench comprising Justice Dipak Misra and Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said a detailed order would be passed later. 
" A new bench of the Supreme Court will on Thursday hear the anticipatory bail plea of activist Teesta Setalvad, facing charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust over alleged embezzlement of funds she had raised for two NGOs who were working for victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The new bench comprises Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel. No reasons were forthcoming on why the case was assigned to a new bench. The Gujarat government had registered the case against her last year. Her anticipatory bail plea and that of her husband Javed Anand was earlier rejected by the Gujarat HC, prompting them to appeal to the top court the same day for fear of being arrested. Their key grouse against the HC ruling was a finding that their custodial interrogation was required to get to the bottom of the matter. Setalvad's counsel Kapil Sibal said this was unnecessary, especially when she had cooperated in the investigations and presented facts in her defence. He had accused the \mighty\"" state of trying to silence her. The state had, however, insisted that she had misused funds to the tune of over Rs 1 crore collected for riot victims on foreign travel, branded clothes and shoes. She denies these allegations. The earlier bench, comprising Justices SJ Mukhopadhaya and NV Ramana, dealing with her case had in their preliminary remarks indicated reluctance to countenance her plea for anticipatory bail, instead suggesting at one point that she first surrender to the police and then apply for regular bail. The bench had suggested the charges against the activist duo was \""serious\"" and she had collected funds by showing \""photos\"" and videos of the riot victims abroad. The earlier had not passed a final order and had said they would hear the case on Thursday. Activists and NGOs had rallied to her cause, suggesting she was being victimised by the state machinery for fighting for the riot victims. """
" The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the arrest of activist Teesta Setalvad and husband Javed Anand till Feb 19, after a half-hourlong hearing during which advocate and Congress leader Kapil Sibal claimed that the activist couple were being targeted by the ruling BJP for their advocacy on behalf if the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The acrimony spilled over when former ASG Indira Jaising, sitting in the audience and watching proceedings alongside the likes of lawyers Prashant Bhushan and TR Andhyarujina, referred to a \Rs 10-lakh suit\"" when the state accused Teesta of using NGO funds for buying \""branded clothes\"" and \""shoes\"". \""We have been observing the sorry state of affairs in this court. People involved in triple murders are given bail. What's going on?\"" she demanded to know. The bench, comprising Justices SJ Mukhopadhaya and NV Ramana, asked her not to intervene as she was not representing anyone in the case. The bench heard Setalvad's lawyer Kapil Sibal and Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Gujarat government before adjourning the case till February 19, 2015. The judges said they would examine the allegations to decide whether it was a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail. At the outset, Justice Mukhopadhaya observed that the \""FIR says you have indulged in the offence in the name of religion. You have collected money and you have used the amount for personal use. Is it a case of anticipatory bail?\"" Sibal argued that she was being victimized for helping the 2002 victims, but Justice Mukhopadhaya asked him not to make political points. Sibal contested the allegation saying that the NGOs have collected only Rs 4 lakh. At best the charges against the couple could be for breach of trust, said Sibal. Justice Mukhopadhaya, who's to retire as SC judge shortly, pointed out that the \""allegation is so grave. You collected money taking undue advantage of riot victims, showed their photos etc in the US. This is a matter for investigation. It is not a case for quashing.\"" Sibal defended Setalvad saying that nothing prevented the police from investigating the case. """
"Gujarat Minister of State for Home Rajni Patel on Wednesday accused Teesta Setalvad of misusing funds given to her NGO by the US based Ford Foundation and said a report of the same has been sent to the Central Government. \The money which was given to her has been spent to spread lies against the Gujarat Government, tarnishing the image of India in international circles, and also to spread communal disharmony. All this information has been forwarded to the Central Home Ministry. Now it is up to the Central Government to take action,\"" Patel said. \""During the investigation of Gulberg Society museum funds embezzlement case, these things came to light. In April, we filed a case against her and as of now the case is going on in the Supreme Court and the courts will decide what has to be done,\"" he added. Meanwhile, Teesta Setalvad said that she and her NGO cooperated fully with the Gujarat government. \""We received a letter from the FCRA department. A four member team headed by a Deputy Secretary came to our offices in Mumbai and was here for one whole week. They have inspected our records and we have provided full cooperation and now they will decide what to do.

Lawyer Prashant Bhushan too asked the court to intervene in the matter. A team of Gujarat Police and Mumbai Police reached Setalvad's home after her bail was rejected. The police teams enquired of her family and staffers on the whereabouts of Setalvad, who was not at home. Setalvad and her husband have been fighting for the victims of the communal carnage that engulfed Gujarat following the burning of a train in Godhra on February 27, 2002. They have been accused of allegedly misappropriating over Rs 14 lakh, collected through their NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace, for setting up a museum at the Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad, where about 69 people were killed during the communal carnage. Setalvad and her husband were booked by the crime branch of Gujarat Police on charges of cheating, breach of trust and under provisions of the IT Act, following a complaint filed by 12 residents of the society after construction of the proposed 'Museum of Resistance' was put in cold storage citing various reasons. The Gujarat Police has accused Setalvad, Anand and three other office-bearers of the NGO of transferring money from its bank account to clear their credit card bills from 2009 to 2014. Setalvad has dismissed the charges saying she had used her credit card for work-related travel and accused the Gujarat Police of manipulating the credit card details to frame her. The case has triggered allegations that Setalvad was targeted for being in the fore-front of the fight against the state government on behalf of the 2002 riot victims. CPM in a statement demanded that the Gujarat government withdraw the \concocted case\"" against Setalvad and \""stop harassing her\"".

In January last year, the city crime branch had registered an FIR against Setalvad and others for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore collected by them in form of donations for turning the colony in Chamanpura into a riots museum. Some former residents of the society alleged that Setalvad and her NGOs restrained them from disposing of their properties after the riots by promising them the NGOs would purchase them and turn them into a riot memorial. However, the properties were never purchased on the ground that there was not enough fund. Later, the NGOs and the office bearers of the society told them that they could sell their houses.

Investigating officer of Gulberg Society fund misuse case, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) KN Patel, filed an affidavit in the high court, reiterating their claims that Setalvad and Anand had misused the money, meant for the 2002 Gujarat riots victims, for their personal use. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and their two NGOs Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace had been frozen by the city crime branch last year. The action came soon after it began investigating the case, in which Setalvad allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society into a 2002 riots museum but later utilised that money for personal use. In an affidavit submitted before Justice Sonia Gokani of the high court, Patel said that Setalvad and Anand spent the riot-victims' funds for their personal and luxury uses. Opposing the couple's pleas, the state agency said both of them, as trustees of the two NGos, through diverse methods allegedly misappropriated the funds. \They have misused the funds meant for the rehabilitation and welfare of the unfortunate victims of riots in Gujarat and money collected for construction of the dream museum,\"" stated the affidavit filed by Patel. The agency said that the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulberg society, which was devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of very personal nature have been debited by them.

Justice Mridula Bhatkar, however, observed that prima facie Teesta and her husband have violated the provisions of FCRA) and directed them to cooperate with the investigations and not instigate anyone to protest against CBI and not indulge in any criminal activity. Justice Bhatkar was hearing the anticipatory bail applications filed by Teesta and Javed in connection with a case registered by CBI alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. β€Prima facie this court holds that there has been violation under the FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act). But where is the threat to national security and public interest? You (CBI) have to show the court this,β€ Justice Bhatkar said. β€After hearing the CBIβ€™s submissions and perusing the documents, this court is of the prima facie view that there may be misuse of the funds received for personal use by the applicant accused. However, I am unable to find out any threat to the security, sovereignty and integrity of the nation or public interest,β€ the court said. It added that a citizen may conduct social activities and may have a different point of view which may not be liked by the government. β€However, in a democratic state, a citizen can have his or her own point of view and it is the duty of the government to protect this view. A dissenting view cannot be said to be against the sovereignty of the government. It may be against the policy of the state,β€ the court said. While granting the duo anticipatory bail, the court said if they are arrested then they shall be released immediately after furnishing surety of Rs 20,000. The CBI while opposing the petitions argued that Teesta and her husband had committed an offence that amounted to a threat to national security and public interest and their custodial interrogation was required. The High Court, however, was not satisfied with the investigating agencyβ€™s arguments, and said the coupleβ€™s custodial interrogation was not required. The court further queried if Teesta and her husband had followed its earlier order of July 24 when the HC had, while granting them interim protection from arrest, directed them to appear before the CBI on four days for recording their statement. CBI counsel Anil Singh told the court that the duo had attended CBI office, but were not cooperating with the investigation. β€They (Teesta and Anand) just come and give vague answers. They do not tell us where the money has gone. They are not providing the account books of the trust. Only the applicants can give CBI information about the trust and the money. CBI cannot take this information from a third party and hence custodial interrogation is required,β€ Singh said. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, appearing for Teesta and Anand, argued that the CBI during its search at the activistβ€™s residence had taken into its custody all original documents pertaining to the trust and its accounts. β€The amount received from the foreign company was not donation and was payment in lieu of services provided to it. The company had deducted TDS from the amount.

Replying to supplementary questions in Rajya Sabha, Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Thaawar Chand Gehlot also asserted that the government was not targeting anyone. His remarks came in the backdrop of recent actions against NGOs like Greenpeace and Ford Foundation's funding of Teesta Setalvad's NGOs. Gehlot said there was no proposal at present for grading of NGOs in general on the basis of qualitative assessment of their performance. Immediately after the reply, B K Hariprasad (Cong) wanted to know from the government and the Prime Minister, who was present in the House, the meaning of \""five-star NGOs\"" even when there was no proposal of grading NGOs.

"Ford funding to non-FCRA NGOs, Setalvad's Sabrang Trust New Delhi, May 5, 2015, (PTI) Ford Foundation has funded several NGOs, which were not registered under the FCRA, and another organisation with which activist Teesta Setalvad is associated. \There are inputs from security agencies that some amounts have been credited from Ford Foundation to some NGOs which are not registered under the provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act 2010. \""Hence, to keep a watch on such recipients, the credits from Ford Foundation has been put under prior permission category under FCRA 2010,\"" Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said in Lok Sabha replying a written question.

"Charities warn Modi that crackdown will hurt the poor New Delhi, May 08, 2015, Reuters Charities in India on Friday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop a government crackdown on thousands of foreign-funded non-profit groups saying it would hurt the lives of poor and marginalised people. Since Modi swept to power almost a year ago, his right-wing nationalist government has tightened surveillance on foreign-funded charities. It says some had violated the law by not disclosing details of their donations, or used overseas money to engage in \anti-national\"" activities. Charities reject the accusations, but admit there may be some groups which had unintended funding discrepancies. They say authorities are using an opaque, \""draconian\"" law on foreign funding to muzzle criticism of initiatives such as industrial projects affecting the poor and the environment. \""Funds are being frozen, intelligence reports are being selectively released to paint NGOs in poor light, disbursal of funds are being subjected to case-by-case clearance, and their activities are reportedly being placed on 'watch lists',\"" said an open letter to Modi signed by 171 charities and activists. \""At the moment it seems that 'compliance' is serving as a garb to actually target those organisations and individuals whose views the government disagrees with, and indeed to monitor and stifle disagreement itself.\"" The letter - signed by groups such as Oxfam India, Human Rights Law Centre and the Conservation Action Trust - said the clampdown was \""arbitrary, non-transparent, and without any course of administrative redress\"". Last month, the government cancelled the licenses of almost 9,000 charities and blocked the bank accounts of Greenpeace India, which has led campaigns against genetically modified crops, coal mining and nuclear power projects. Greenpeace says it now faces closure within a month due to a shortage of funds and has accused the government of \""strangulation by stealth\"". Big donors like the U.S.-based Ford Foundation are also being investigated. Ford Foundation faces a probe of its funding of a group run by Teesta Setalvad, a prominent rights activist and critic of Modi. U.S. Ambassador Richard Verma to India said this week he was worried about \""the potentially chilling effects\"" of the action against the NGOs, while Germany's top diplomat Michael Steiner said charities should be supported for their \""impressive work\"". Foreign Funds There is no official number of charities operating in India, but the government estimates there are at least two million non-profits - working in areas from conservation, education and health to protecting the rights of minorities. A 2013 report by the home ministry said that while more than 43,500 - around 2 percent - were registered as charities which receive foreign funds in 2011/12, only 22,700 had provided details of their donations. Home ministry officials say they were now simply enforcing the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), a law which bars overseas donations going to NGOs of a \""political nature\"". A leaked intelligence service report in June 2014 said local branches of organisations such as Greenpeace, Amnesty International and ActionAid were using foreign funds to damage the country's economy with anti-industry campaigns. The groups have been involved in many campaigns in which they have supported indigenous communities to successfully mobilise against big mining firms such as Vedanta and Essar. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led government is keen increase investment in infrastructure and make it easier for businesses to buy land to boost growth. This jars with NGOs who oppose what they say is economic development at the cost of the poor and the environment. Go to Top Tweet"""

"Ignoring political bosses and changing portfolios of senior officers in the Ministry without the knowledge of Home Minister Rajnath Singh cost L C Goyal the post of Union Home Secretary, highly-placed sources said. Goyal, who was ousted from the high-profile job yesterday, is said to have ignored Singh's advice on many occasions. However, when contacted, Goyal told PTI that he had nothing to say beyond what he had said yesterday. \I don't want to say anything beyond what I said yesterday,\"" he said. He had yesterday said it was his own decision and any other reason being mentioned was \""factually incorrect\"". The sources, who did not want to be identified said, Goyal had recently ordered change of portfolios of two Additional Secretaries and a Joint Secretary without consulting the Home Minister, an act which made Singh furious. The Home Minister even used his Deputy Kiren Rijiju to persuade Goyal not to take such decisions unilaterally but he apparently paid little attention to such advice. Singh had to overrule all the decisions and restored the portfolios of the Additional Secretaries and the Joint Secretary. The Home Minister had been receiving complaints of several Joint Secretaries that many proposals of the Home Ministry were turned down by Goyal even at the conceptualisation stage without consulting the Minister or any of the two Ministers of State. On several occasions, the Home Minister or his two Deputies had to overrule the Home Secretary leading to further differences between them, the sources said. The trigger for taking the final decision came when Goyal, changed the portfolio of a Joint Secretary handling the Disaster Management Division last week without keeping the bosses informed. \""At this point of time, the Home Minister thought enough is enough and went to the Prime Minister seeking removal of Goyal, which the Prime Minister had agreed,\"" a source said. Sources said Goyal showed rules books on several occasions and even refused to act despite clear cut instructions from political leadership. Goyal was also said to have been running a long battle with Additional Secretary A K Singh, who was considered close to the Home Minister. A K Singh was also shifted yesterday to the Petroleum Ministry, apparently due to a balancing act by the Home Minister. The former Home Secretary also had differences with the government on certain key issues including the recent Naga accord, denial of security clearance to SUN TV owned by the Maran group and issues related to an NGO headed by activist Teesta Setalvad. Goyal was yesterday replaced after only seven months in office and another senior IAS officer Rajiv Mehrishi was appointed in his place on the day of his superannuation. A statement by the PMO also said that the Prime Minister had also approved the request of Goyal seeking voluntary retirement \""due to personal reasons with immediate effect\"".

NEW DELHI: The Gujarat High Court today rejected the anticipatory bail of social activists Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and three others accused of misappropriation of trust funds collected on behalf of Gujarat riots victims. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court Thursday restrained police from arresting Teesta Setalvad and her husband for one day till Friday. After the Gujarat High Court declined her plea for anticipatory bail, a team of Gujarat Police and Mumbai police scouted the home of social activist Teesta Setalvad. A bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu, while restraining police from arresting Setalvad and her husband for one day, directed the listing of the matter Friday. The court gave the order after counsel Kapil Sibal mentioned the matter before it. The case was filed against her in Gujarat. The case pertains to an FIR registered by the Ahmedabad Crime Branch last January, which alleges Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, Zakia Jafri's son Tanvir Jafri and two others of usurping Rs 1.51 crore meant for the construction of a memorial for the riot-ravaged Gulbarg Society victims.

Police said that Gulbarg Society residents had told them that they had been giving the money for the so-called museum project from 2007 to 2012. It was later discovered that Setalvad had placed the money in fixed deposits in her name. Denying any misuse of funds, Setalwad has blamed political motives behind the case. 68 people residing in Gulbarg Society lost their lives during the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat in 2002.
MHA issues notice to NGOs run by Teesta Setalvad New Delhi: Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notice by Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

Teesta NGO under lens New Delhi, June 27, 2015, DHNS: In yet another action against civil society organisations, activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO will face CBI probe on charges of misuse of foreign funds to the tune of Rs 3 crore, even as the Union Home Ministry has seized its bank account that deals with contributions from abroad. Setalvad, who heads Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, is in the forefront of the legal fight on behalf of Gujarat riot victims against the state government and the then chief minister, Narendra Modi. She has been accused of embezzling funds meant for the riot victims. Senior Home Ministry officials said they had found that funds received by Setalvad's NGO from the Ford Foundation were transferred to Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) without permission from the authorities concerned. The Home Ministry has frozen the NGO's IDBI bank account as it was maintained against the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) regulations. Setalvad was not available for comments. As per the letter sent to the CBI, the ministry said SCPPL received foreign donation of $290,000 and Rs 1.30 crore in β€contraventionβ€ of the FCRA and without getting its clearance.

Despite court rulings, govt on overdrive against NGOs Shemin Joy, June 28, 2015, DHNS The Foreigners Division in Union Home Ministry seems to be burning midnight oil these days to take on NGOs. Since the leakage of an Intelligence Bureau report on NGOs in June last year, the efforts to β€teach a lessonβ€ to those civil society organisations for β€putting the clock backβ€ had gathered steam. It is now reaching a crescendo with news spilling out every other day about an NGO coming under the scanner. For the authorities, the NGOs have suddenly become an β€agent of disruptionβ€ who should be β€containedβ€ even at the cost of facing allegations of muzzling dissent. On its own, the government apparatus has declared it to be the sole custodian and guardian of β€national interestβ€ while those voices of dissent, whether it is an individual or an organisation, are branded anti-development and anti-national. No doubt, one has to follow the law of the land. They have to be accountable and transparent. Erring NGOs will have to face music. At the same time, question arises whether the recent overdrive against NGOs stand the test of reason. Does governmentβ€™s high moral ground on safeguarding countryβ€™s interest act as a buffer to stifle rights based protests? The last two months have witnessed a variety of activities against NGOs despite the Home Ministry having egg on its face after Delhi High Court, on at least three occasions, ruling against the government. The ministry was asked to defreeze accounts of Greenpeace at least twice, while it also ruled as illegal the offloading of London-bound Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai. Despite the reverses, Greenpeace India still faces closure with the government squeezing it with a show cause notice. Ford Foundation has been put on prior permission list, while Greenpeace International activist Aaron Gray-Block was denied entry, permission to 8,975 NGOs to collect foreign funds were cancelled and draft amendments to have a real time monitoring of receipt and use of foreign funds. The Home Ministry has been busy throughout the summer. The latest in this string of actions is the CBI probe into the β€misuseβ€ of foreign funds by Teesta Setalvadβ€™s NGO Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd. If one may find this action curious, he cannot be blamed as Setalvad was in the forefront of a relentless fight against Narendra Modi, then Gujarat chief minister. Strong-arm tactics One may have a view about the whole NGO concept like CPI(M)β€™s Prakash Karat who wrote one of the finest critiques in 1984 on such outfits. He emphasised the need for a β€sustained ideological campaignβ€ against the β€pseudo-radical posturesβ€ of such action groups. Their role and the question of what interests they serve should be debated. That exactly is not happening. Over a period of time, governments are using strong-arm tactics to deal with them. Government and political leadership have reasons to fear NGOs and it lies in their failure to connect to people and take up their cause. That is why they fear NGOs which uses their networking and other skills to reach out to the affected masses. The NGOs reach out to people who are otherwise not attended by mainstream parties. If a mainstream politician does not find time and energy to address the concerns of affected parties in a far-off Mahan or Niyamgiri or Narmada or Kudankulam on the pretext of developmental concerns, the victims will flock to those who provide succor. If a government forcess development down the throat of common man, then there would be dissent. It is this dissent that government fears as it can turn into a hurricane that can question its very existence. The problem with the government is that it perceives civil society as an extension of governance structure where it is just meant to help officials with reports and suggestions. The government always wants pliable NGOs. They want to create a pool of NGOs which would be sympathetic to them. They have to understand that civil society is not an extension but an independent arm of any democratic set up. In such a scenario, there will be dissent and the government will have to listen. During the UPA regime, the consultation with NGOs was institutionalised through the National Advisory Council (NAC) but the relationship with the civil society hit a rock bottom as they took on corruption in the government. The NDA government as a whole shares the distrust Prime Minister Narendra Modi has for NGOs. The Modi government has heightened the decibel levels, repeating UPA argument that many NGOs are acting against the economic interests of the country. The question remains whether the political leadership is listening to grievances of the common man. Instead of addressing the grievances, the government is, sadly, trying to muzzle dissent in the name of development in which a majority has little stake and only loss of livelihood.

Narendra Modi & Rajnath Singh The appointment of Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi as Union home secretary has taken everyone by surprise, even bureaucrats and journalists who frequent North Block daily for news and gossip. No one knew that incumbent Home Secretary L C Goyal, a 1979-batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer of Kerala cadre, had sought voluntary retirement. The government on Monday appointed Goyal as the chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO). Set up in 1977, ITPO is the nodal trade promotion agency of the government and functions under the supervision of the commerce ministry. Advertisement ALSO READ:Β Rajiv Mehrishi appointed home secretary The Union home secretary or HS is the most important position in the Union government by virtue of the importance of the role and the appointee has a fixed tenure of two years. As a symbol of the importance of these posts, in addition to the home secretary, those who have a fixed two-year term are only the defence and external affairs secretaries. They can be removed under two conditions β€” either the government cuts short their tenure asΒ  happened in the case of former external affairs secretary Sujatha Singh, a 1976-batch officer of the elite Indian Foreign Services (IFS), or the officers opt for voluntary retirement. Goyalβ€™s predecessor Anil Goswami had taken the second route after he left following his name came up in a CBI case. The government curtailed the services of Singh months before her scheduled retirement. Singh had allegedly refused to take the VRS route. Many explain the government removed Singh ostensibly to make space for her successor S Jaishankar, a 1977 batch IFS officer, who was retiring in the next few days. Now the same holds true for Mehrishi, a 1978-batch IAS, who was specially brought from Rajasthan to work in the Union finance ministry last year. Mehrishi is considered to be a close confidant of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and he was supposed to retire on August 31. Goyal is seen as close to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. In the recent past, the finance ministry and the Union home ministry have differed on issues, including the case relating to Sun TV. The appointment of Mehrishi has also defied another trend. The government usually prefers those officers for the post of home secretary who earlier served in the ministry in some capacity. Though Mehrishi has served in various ministries, he has never worked in the home ministry. Some see Mehrishiβ€™s appointment as Modi exercising direct control over the countryβ€™s plum ministry. A total 15 additional secretaries and 20 joint secretaries have been appointed in various central government ministries in Mondayβ€™s reshuffle. Senior IAS officer Atanu Purkayastha has been appointed as secretary in Central Information Commission (CIC) as part of a major senior-level bureaucratic reshuffle effected by the government on Monday. Senior Indian Foreign Service officer Sanjeev Kumar Singla, who is private secretary in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), was promoted to the rank of joint secretary. In another order, K Vijay Raghavan has been given additional charge of secretary, ministry of earth sciences, in place of Shailesh Nayak who relinquished the charge on Monday. EXIT WOUNDS?

The HC said that \""prima facie it appears that there is some misuse of amount they received from the Foundation for which (Teesta and Javed) are undoubtedly answerable\"". The court however did not agree with the CBI's claim that the activities were a threat. \""Prima facie, (the court) is unable to find out any threat to sovereignty and integrity of India or threat to the security strategic or economic interest of the State or public interest.\"" The court said the case is based on accounts and documents for which custodial interrogation was not necessary . Additional solicitor general Anil Singh insisted that custodial interrogation was necessary as the couple was not cooperating with CBI and only they could explain how the funds were used. Singh con tended that \""Ford Foundation has encouraged the Sabrang Trust advocating for a religion-specific and Muslim supportive criminal code and also supported to keep the 2002 riots incident in Gujarat alive\"". The advocate alleged that Sabrang was a proxy for Ford Foundation and added that \""Ford Foundation has supported the institution in India to be operating on the premises of stoking religious tensions with their social prejudices.\"" Senior advocates Aspi Chinoy and Mihir Desai, counsel for Teesta and Javed, argued that the Ford Foundation money was not a donation but a payment for consultancy services and therefore does not come under FCRA rules. At the most it was a case of different interpretation of the law, the advocates said, adding that the couple had submitted all the bank accounts and ledgers from 2004 onwards. They also claimed TDS was deducted and I-T returns filed for the amounts. The lawyers said the case was politically motivated. The HC said the couple was unlikely to flee the country and asked them to inform CBI whenever they leave Mumbai.The court said in the event of arrest, the couple should be released on bail of Rs 20,000 each and sureties and asked them to cooperate with investigations.They have also been directed not to indulge in any activity that violates laws."""
"Mumbai: In a relief to Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Bombay High Court today granted anticipatory bail to the activist couple in a Foreign Contribution Regulations Act violation case, saying it is unable to find any threat to national security or public interest if they remain free. Β  PIC/@TeestaSetalvad (Twitter) Β  The court while granting bail to the duo also held that it does not find any possibility of the accused persons fleeing from justice and that their custodial interrogation was not required. Β  Justice Mridula Bhatkar, however, observed that prima facie Teesta and her husband have violated the provisions of FCRA) and directed them to cooperate with the investigations and not instigate anyone to protest against CBI and not indulge in any criminal activity. Justice Bhatkar was hearing the anticipatory bail applications filed by Teesta and Javed in connection with a case registered by CBI alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Β  \Prima facie this court holds that there has been violation under the FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act). But where is the threat to national security and public interest? You (CBI) have to show the court this,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. Β  \""After hearing the CBI's submissions and perusing the documents, this court is of the prima facie view that there may be misuse of the funds received for personal use by the applicant accused. However, I am unable to find out any threat to the security, sovereignty and integrity of the nation or public interest,\"" the court said. Β  It added that a citizen may conduct social activities and may have a different point of view which may not be liked by the government. Β  \""However, in a democratic state, a citizen can have his or her own point of view and it is the duty of the government to protect this view. A dissenting view cannot be said to be against the sovereignty of the government. It may be against the policy of the state,\"" the court said. While granting the duo anticipatory bail, the court said if they are arrested then they shall be released immediately after furnishing surety of Rs 20,000. Β  The CBI while opposing the petitions argued that Teesta and her husband had committed an offence that amounted to a threat to national security and public interest and their custodial interrogation was required. Β  The High Court, however, was not satisfied with the investigating agency's arguments, and said the couple's custodial interrogation was not required. Β  The court further queried if Teesta and her husband had followed its earlier order of July 24 when the HC had, while granting them interim protection from arrest, directed them to appear before the CBI on four days for recording their statement. Β  CBI counsel Anil Singh told the court that the duo had attended CBI office, but were not cooperating with the investigation. Β  \""They (Teesta and Anand) just come and give vague answers. They do not tell us where the money has gone. They are not providing the account books of the trust. Only the applicants can give CBI information about the trust and the money. CBI cannot take this information from a third party and hence custodial interrogation is required,\"" Singh said. Β  Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, appearing for Teesta and Anand, argued that the CBI during its search at the activist's residence had taken into its custody all original documents pertaining to the trust and its accounts. Β  \""The amount received from the foreign company was not donation and was payment in lieu of services provided to it. The company had deducted TDS from the amount. The TDS certificated were produced before the Income Tax department by Teesta. Since the amount was not donation, it cannot be considered under the FCRA,\"" Chinoy said. Β  The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.90 lakh USD in foreign donations, in violation of FCRA. Β  According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.90 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Β  Setalvad alleged that the FIR registered against her and her husband was for the purpose of harassing and torturing them, a charge rejected by CBI."""
"CBI ends 3-day recording of Teesta, hubby's statement in FCRA case Mumbai, July 20, 2015 (PTI) Activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand today concluded recording of their statement before CBI in connection with a case against their firm for allegedly receiving around USD 2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The couple appeared before the central probe agency on three consecutive days since Saturday pursuant to Friday's directive of CBI special judge Anis Khan, who had reserved his order on their anticipatory bail applications till tomorrow while granting them interim protection from arrest. The CBI, which registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited, has alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. \We have recorded our statement on three consecutive days as per the directions of the court. Beyond this I can't share anything as per the orders of my lawyers,\"" Setalvad later said. The CBI sleuths had searched four premises owned by Setalvad, Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam, and the office of SCPPL on July 14. The probe agency had opposed the bail plea contending the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected \""interference towards the internal security and activities of India\"" and also contested Setalvad's claim that the money received was a fee for consultancy. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation (a US-based NGO) and SCPPL was seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants. There is no mention of any 'consultancy' therein,\"" the CBI told the court. The CBI, which is probing the firm's accounts from 2004 to 2014, claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money received from the Ford Foundation had not been cleared by the Home Ministry. In a related move, the couple has moved an application before a court in Mumbai challenging the raids carried out by CBI, citing the Crinimal Procedure Code which provides for conducting a raid only in circumstances when the accused is not cooperating. The court will hear the petition on July 27. Setalvad, during the July 14 raids by CBI, had termed the action as a\"" shameful political vendetta\"". \""The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27 2015. The Naroda Patiya appeals (Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) are being heard in the Gujarat High Court tomorrow. This is nothing but a bid to subvert the cause of public justice and ensure that no justice happens in these cases,\"" she had said in a statement.

"Teesta refutes Guj police's charge of funds misappropriation Ahmedabad, Jul 24, 2015 (PTI) Social activist Teesta Setalvad, accused of embezzling funds meant for victims of the Gulberg Housing Society, today rebutted the charges made by Gujarat Police that she and her husband had misappropriated the funds for personal expenses. The statement by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, who are trustees of the two NGOs in question, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust, issued here said the funds raised for the construction of a memorial at Gulberg Society massacre site were still lying unutilised. \Since we, Sabrang Trust only managed to raise Rs 4.6 lakh, we had to inform the Society (members of Gulberg society) that the Memorial project was not feasible,\"" the statement said. \""No contract was ever signed, no property or deed ever changed hands, no rent was promised nor monies changed hands. The Rs 4.6 lakh donated by individuals (all Indians, including one NRI) are still unutilised,\"" it claimed. The statement was issued by Setalvad after Gujarat police filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. Opposing the the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad in the apext court, the state police had alleged that the duo had misappropriated funds that was meant for building a museum at Gulberg Society massacre site, for personal expenses ranging from wine, ear-buds to expensive mobile phone. In the affidavit, the police had said that Setalvad and Anand as trustees of the two trusts -- Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice and Peace (CJP) -- have by \""diverse methods\"" allegedly \""misappropriated funds of charity and converted to their own use funds ment for rehabilitation of riot victims\"". Refuting the allegations, the activist today said CJP raised money for providing legal aid to victims and its record in this respect is \""unprecedented\"" in India. \""Witness protection and probity during the trial despite hostile regimes have ensured the convictions of 120 persons,\"" their statement said. \""All payments to Teesta or Javed were strictly in accordance with the budgets proposed to and accepted by Ford Foundation, UNVFVT (United Nations Voluntarily Fund for Victims of Torture), CRY,\"" the statement said on Gujarat Police's claims that salaries of Setalvad and her husband started increasing exponentially every year. The Gujarat Police had alleged that 45 per cent of total funds received by Sabrang Trust between 2008 and 2013 have gone to Setalvad and her husband either directly or through Sabrang Communication Pvt Ltd (SCPPL), which was fully owned by them. Refuting the charge, the statement said, \""All payments by CJP and ST (Sabrang Trust) towards reimbursements for shared expenses were as per resolutions passed from time to time by their respective trustees.\"" \""Teesta and Javed recused themselves from the decisions taken in all such instances,\"" the statement added. \""Sabrang Communication made no profit from the expenses sharing arrangement and Teesta and Javed were not paid even a rupee out of such reimbursements,\"" it claimed.

"Interim relief for Teesta, her husband; no arrest till Aug 10 Mumbai, Jul 24, 2015 (PTI) In a breather to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband, the Bombay High Court today granted the duo 17-day interim relief from arrest in a CBI case alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting Teesta and her husband Javed Anand interim protection from arrest till August 10, said the duo was already given protection by the sessions court. Teesta and Anand moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail after a special CBI court today rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas and also refused to extend the interim relief granted to them earlier on July 17. \At this stage I do not want to go into merits. Is there any chance of the accused persons absconding? If no, then interim protection can be granted for a period of two weeks,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. The court directed Teesta and her husband to appear before the office of Economic Offences Wing of CBI on July 27 and 30 and on August 3 and 6 for recording their statement from 12pm to 3pm. The court refused to agree to the CBI's demand to direct the duo to appear before the agency everyday. \""They (Teesta and Javed) have been appearing before you (CBI) from July 17. You must have done some investigation. Everyday appearance is not required,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. Public Prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, appearing for CBI, argued that the offence was of a serious nature and custodial interrogation was required. The court has posted their anticipatory bail petitions for final hearing on August 10. Soon after the sessions court rejected her bail pleas, Teesta told the court that she was shocked and aggrieved. \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic),\"" she said. The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the special CBI court that they were innocent and were falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them was to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI in their reply, last Friday, had said that the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India. \""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation. Setalvad alleged that the FIR registered against her and her husband was for the purpose of harassing and torturing them, a charge rejected by CBI. \""The applicants are deliberately mixing up the offences alleged against them with non-related issues in order to divert the attention from the serious charges against them,\"" the agency had said. The CBI had also told the court that when their premises were searched on July 14 this year there was total resistance and non-cooperation from their side. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation and SCPPL were seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants.

"Teesta Setalvad's NGO CJP put under 'prior permission' list New Delhi, Jul 24, 2015 (PTI) Compounding activist Teesta Setalvad's trouble, her NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) has been put under Prior Permission category by the Home Ministry. The decision has been taken following an investigation by the Home Ministry which found alleged violation of various provisions ofΒ  Foreign Contribution Regulation Act by CJP. \The NGO will have to take prior permission from the foreigners division of the Home Ministry before accepting or utilising the foreign contribution,\"" an official said. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabarang Trust, run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, were served notices by the Home Ministry about two months ago asking the NGOs why their registration under FCRA would not be cancelled as on-site inspection of records and books of accounts of the two found \""irregularities and financial misappropriation\"". While CJP was registered for 'Educational and Economic' purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as 'Legal Aid' which is covered under purpose 'Social'. Hence, it violated FCRA rules, the Home Ministry contended. \""On review of vouchers of the Association, it was found that Sabrang Trust (another NGO of Teesta) have made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand. \""This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus, the Association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,\"" the Home Ministry notice had said. The Ministry's investigation also found that Anand has taken international medical policy for visiting Lahore and debited the amount in the account of Sabrang Trust. Facing the notices, the two NGOs have conveyed to the Home Ministry that they have done no financial irregularities and no foreign contribution was misused by any of its office bearer.

Mumbai: Ruling out any threats to national security or public interest, the Bombay High Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a case pertaining to violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulations Act. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting bail, said their custodial interrogation was not required as the court did not find any possibility of the accused fleeing from justice. Observing that prima facie the couple had violated the FCRA provisions, she directed them to cooperate with the investigating agencies and refrain from instigating any protests against the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or indulge in any criminal acts. Justice Bhatkar's ruling came in the anticipatory bail pleas filed by the duo following a case registered by the CBI accusing their company of receiving a foreign donation of Rs.1.80 crore without mandatory sanctions from the central government. 'Prima facie, this court holds there has been violation under FCRA. But where is the threat to the security, sovereignty and integrity of the nation or public interest,' Justice Bhatkar said, asking the CBI to show this to the court. While granting anticipatory bail, the court directed that if Setalvad-Anand are arrested, then they shall be released immediately on a surety of Rs.20,000. The judge said that any citizen may carry out social activities which may have a different point of view which the government may not like. Opposing the anticipatory bail plea by the couple, the CBI contended that the duo has committed an offence which amounted to a threat to national security and public interest, and hence their custodial interrogation was required. Asked whether the duo had complied with the court's earlier order of July 24 granting them interim relief from arrest and asking them to appear before the CBI on four days for recording their statement, CBI counsel Anil Singh replied that they came to the CBI office but were not cooperating with the probe. He said that they just came and gave vague answers, did not reveal where the money has gone, are not providing the trust's books of accounts, for which it needed their custodial interrogation. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy representing the couple pointed out that during its searches at their premises (Setalvad and Anand), the CBI had seized all original documents pertaining to the trust and the accounts. He added that the amount received from foreign parties was not a donation but fees in return for services provided to it, for which tax was deducted at source, and accordingly it could not be considered under FCRA. On July 8, the CBI had lodged a case against Setalvad and Anand alleging that their NGO Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt. Ltd received a foreign donation of $2.90 lakh violating FCRA provisions. IANS
"Teesta Setalvad The Bombay High Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, who are being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for alleged misappropriation of funds received from a foreign institution. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while refusing the CBI's plea seeking custodial interrogation of the two, noted, \Prima facie, I am unable to find any act which would bear a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state or threat to the security, strategic, economic or public interest.\"" Justice Bhatkar rejected CBI's argument that the criminal antecedents of the two activists, who have been highlighting the cause of victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots, need to be gone into before deciding on the anticipatory bail application. \""A citizen may conduct social activities and have a different point of view, which may not be liked by the government. However, in a democratic state, a citizen may have his/her different point of view and the state should protect that different point of view,\"" the court said. \""A dissenting view cannot be termed as against the sovereignty of the state. It may be said that it is against the policy of the state. These are two different things.\"" The court granted anticipatory bail to each of them for Rs20,000, in case of arrest, and directed them to cooperate with the CBI and make themselves available to the probe agency as and when required, until filing of the charge sheet. The special CBI court had, in July, rejected the plea which was challenged in the high court. Justice Bhatkar, while allowing it, took into consideration that the accused were Indians and their probability of absconding was negligible. \""Prima facie, the case is relating to accounts not maintained and unavailable documents. If they are not produced, then a prosecution can be lodged and charges framed, for which custodial interrogation is not required,\"" she said. The CBI had, on July 8, registered a case against Setalvad and Anand, alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) had received around 2.90 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). It is alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs1.8 crore was, therefore, received in violation of the Act, as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the union home ministry. The activists were not disclosing where they had utilised the funds received. However, the activists, through their counsel Aspi Chenoy, had argued that the funds received were not donations but fees paid towards the services hired by the foreign organisation, Four Foundation.

Setalvad, who has been working for providing justice to Gujrat riot victims, along with her husband has been facing legal actions for allegedly diverting foreign funds. \""The whole government machinery has been engaged in harassing and intimidating Setalvad and Javed. Is the government trying to say that look, these are consequences you will face if you dare to raise you voice against us?\"" asked Harsh Mander, Director, Centre for Equity Studies. Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabarang Trust, run by Teesta and Anand, were served notices by the Home Ministry about two months ago asking the NGOs why their registration under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) would not be cancelled as on-site inspection of records and books of accounts of the two found \""irregularities and financial misappropriation\"". Questioning the timing of government's action against Setalvad, activists alleged that it is an attempt to thwart her efforts to bring justice to the victims since the cases she has been fighting have reached crucial legal stage. \""Why is it all being done now after 12 longs years? They want to divert the attention by engaging her legal charges. They want to hamper the cases of the victims as they have reached crucial stages and carry 25,000 pages of evidence against important people in the government,\"" Madhu Prasad, a retired associate professor of Delhi University, said. \""The hounding of Teesta Setalvad is timed to coincide with the publicly articulated urge of the Prime Minister to get a 'clean chit' from the courts in relation to the ongoing cases in Gujarat, which Teesta has been doggedly pursuing. She is the victim of the pursuit for justice,\"" she added. Go to Top Tweet"""
Teesta now accused of buying support Ahmedabad, July 29, 2015, DHNS The Ahmedabad crime branch officials on Tuesday said that they have material evidence which would help them nail activist Teesta Setalvad in the case Gulbarg Society case. Setalvad is accused of collecting Rs 1.51 crore through her two NGOs β€” Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice & Peace (CJP) β€” from domestic and international donors with a promise to convert riot-hit Gulbarg into a museum. However, it is alleged, that she used the money for her personal expenses. The Ahmedabad Police had registered an FIR in 2014, after a complaint filed by former residents of Gulbarg Society a year-and-a-half ago in 2013. They apparently claimed that money collected in their name had not reached them. Setalvad on her part stated that only Rs 4.6 lakh could be raised for the project, forcing her to abandon the project.Β  As for the trust funds, she claimed that they had been audited and submitted before the concerned authorities. The Crime Branch officials now said that Teestaβ€™s Sabrang Trust had paid for air tickets, food bills, local taxi and other expenses of John Dayal, Harsh Mander and Dr Amarjeet Singh Narang and debited these expenses to Secular Education Account of Sabrang Trust. The propping up of these names by the Crime Branch become interesting as they have been supporters of Teestaβ€™s work for long. John Dayal, secretary-general of the All India Christian Council and Harsh Mander, a former IAS officer and director, Centre for Equity Studies had recently alleged that Teesta was being hounded by Gujarat government for her support to the riot victims.β€The payment ledger of Sabrang Trust indicates an amount of Rs 11,579 being paid to Setalvad towards reimbursement of air tickets booked for Dayal from Delhi to Mumbai. They also received payment for the airport transfers and out of the pocket expenses. And we are just talking about only few vouchers yet,β€ they said, adding that these payments were indicative that Dayal and Mander were paid supporters of Setalvad as they were approved by Setalvadβ€™s husband Javed Anand.

The company had deducted TDS from the amount. The TDS certificated were produced before the Income Tax department by Teesta.

The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.90 lakh USD in foreign donations, in violation of FCRA. According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.90 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry.

The sudden exit of LC Goyal as Home Secretary and appointment of Rajiv Mehrishi, who was to retire on Monday, as his successor came as a surprise for senior government officials, triggering widespread speculations.Β  Hours after his exit Goyal, who was in charge of issues like internal security, terrorism, public order and centre-state relations, was appointed chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO).Β  ITPO is the nodal agency for promotion of trade in the country. Functioning under the Ministry of Commerce, the body is also responsible for organising trade fairs.Β  The unexpected change in profile has come with Goyal only spending seven months as home secretary and his two-year tenure coming to an abrupt end.Β  While Goyal on his part maintained that he opted for voluntary retirement purely for personal reasons, the buzz in the corridors of power was that there could be more to the unceremonious exit, which was similar to others under the Narendra Modi government.Β  β€There was no inkling of something like this,β€ said an official, adding that it has taken everyone by surprise.Β  A PMO statement said Modi approved the appointment of Mehrishi as home secretary for a period of two years with effect from August 31. Mehrishi, an IAS officer of 1978 batch from Rajasthan cadre, was to superannuate the same day as secretary, department of economic affairs.Β  Goyalβ€™s unexpected resignation is being viewed against the backdrop of a series of controversies in the home ministry surrounding the denial of security clearance to Sun TV owned by the Maran group, issues related to an NGO headed by social activist Teesta Setalvad and the Naga accord in which the home ministry was kept out of the loop.Β  In the Maran security clearance case, the MHA stuck to its stand despite a legal opinion given by Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi that the action was uncalled for.Β  In the Teesta case it is believed that the government was unhappy since the MHA didnβ€™t act swiftly.Β  β€These are all in the realm of speculation. These things keep happening in government functioning but top officials are not shunted for it,β€ said a government official.Β  Another reason being cited is that there were internal differences in the MHA with certain officials lobbying against Goyal, leading to misgivings.Β  Despite the speculation there is a view that the most important factor for Goyalβ€™s exit was to accommodate Mehrishi, who is considered close to PM Modi and was also in the race for cabinet secretary, sources said.Β  Goyal, who had a clean image with no blot on his career, insisted he was not upset with the government and said that his decision to take voluntary retirement was personal.Β  β€For personal reasons, I didnβ€™t want to continue. It was my own decision,β€ Goyal said.β€Β  At the same time, Goyal, who turned 60, said he is fit and there are no health reasons for his exit.
Just seven months after he took over as Union Home Secretary, LC Goyal has taken took premature retirement. He was replaced by Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, who was set to retire on Monday. Goyal's tenure was till February 2017 With eyebrows being raised, the government appointed him as CMD of Indian Trade Promotion Organisation within hours. The ITPO's main responsibility is to organise the annual trade fair in Delhi. Mehrishi became the third Home Secretary to be appointed within a year. Goyal was appointed in February after his predecessor Anil Goswami's disgraceful exit due to his links with Saradha scam-accused, Mathang Singh. On Monday afternoon, the Prime Minister's Office issued a press release instead of the Department of Personnel and Training, announcing Goyal's retirement and Mehrishi's appointment. Though Goyal attributed personal reasons for the move, some insiders claim his refusal to give security clearance to Sun Network for its FM and TV channels could be a reason. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry headed by Arun Jaitley was opposed to the Home Ministry's stand on the issue. Others suggested the PMO was unhappy with the speed with which Goyal was working on the FCRA violations case against Teesta Setalvad and her NGOs). The Home Ministry has put Ford Foundation, the key contributor to Setalvad's NGO under the scanner and sent a notice to Sabrang Foundation for violations, but is yet to cancel their licence.

"Ahmedabad:Β  The city police, probing the alleged Gulberg Society fund misuse case, on Wednesday opposed the pleas filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gujarat High Court to de-freeze their and their two NGOs' bank accounts. Investigating officer of Gulberg Society fund misuse case, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) KN Patel, filed anaffidavit in the high court, reiterating their claims that Setalvad and Anand had misused the money, meant for the 2002 Gujarat riots victims, for their personal use. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and their two NGOs Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace had been frozen by the city crime branch last year. The action came soon after it began investigating the case, in which Setalvad allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society into a 2002 riots museum but later utilised that money for personal use. In an affidavit submitted before Justice Sonia Gokani of the high court, Patel said that Setalvad and Anand spent the riot-victims' funds for their personal and luxury uses. Opposing the couple's pleas, the state agency said both of them, as trustees of the two NGos, through diverse methods allegedly misappropriated the funds. \They have misused the funds meant for the rehabilitation and welfare of the unfortunate victims of riots in Gujarat and money collected for construction of the dream museum,\"" stated the affidavit filed by Patel. The agency said that the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulberg society, which was devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of very personal nature have been debited by them. The high court is likely to conduct hearing on the case on August 19.

New Delhi: Just seven months after he took over as Union Home Secretary, LC Goyal has taken premature retirement. He was replaced by Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, who was set to retire on Monday. Goyal's tenure was till February 2017. With eyebrows being raised, the government appointed him as CMD of Indian Trade Promotion Organisation within hours. The ITPO's main responsibility is to organise the annual trade fair in Delhi. Mehrishi became the third Home Secretary to be appointed within a year. Goyal was appointed in February after his predecessor Anil Goswami's disgraceful exit due to his links with Saradha scam-accused, Mathang Singh. On Monday afternoon, the Prime Minister's Office issued a press release instead of the Department of Personnel and Training, announcing Goyal's retirement and Mehrishi's appointment. Though Goyal attributed personal reasons for the move, some insiders claim his refusal to give security clearance to Sun Network for its FM and TV channels could be a reason. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry headed by Arun Jaitley was opposed to the Home Ministry's stand on the issue. Others suggested the PMO was unhappy with the speed with which Goyal was working on the FCRA violations case against Teesta Setalvad and her NGOs). The Home Ministry has put Ford Foundation, the key contributor to Setalvad's NGO under the scanner and sent a notice to Sabrang Foundation for violations, but is yet to cancel their licences.
"NEW DELHI: Activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Monday drew a contrast in the Centre's action against social activist Teesta Setalvad and political parties on the issue of receiving foreign funds in alleged violation of law. Bhushan told the Supreme Court that the Centre had been very quick to take action against 'Greenpeace' and Setalvad for getting foreign funds in alleged violation of law but for years it had failed to proceed against BJP and Congress which too were accused of receiving overseas funds in violation of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA). He told a bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy that the NDA government had been reluctant in taking action against the political parties despite the Delhi High Court in March last year directing the authorities to initiate proceedings against them for getting foreign funds. \The government was very quick in taking action against Greenpeace and Teesta in FCRA violation case but for the last 16 months it did not take any action against the political parties. The government has not moved even an inch despite the high court asking it to take action,\"" Bhushan said. The court was hearing petitions filed by BJP and the Congress challenging the March 28, 2014 order of HC, which had held that they were liable to be proceeded against for receiving funds from Vedanta subsidiaries. The HC had asked the Centre and the Election Commission (EC) to act against them. Challenging the order of the high court, both BJP and Congress told SC that Vedanta is owned by an Indian citizen and its subsidiaries are incorporated here, therefore they are not foreign sources. BJP and Congress had appealed against the order in the SC. However, till date the government has not clarified its stand. He also said that the government has a conflict of interest in this issue as BJP is the ruling party at the Centre. The court asked the Centre to file its response within three weeks. Interpreting FCRA (1976) and the Companies Act, the HC had held that \""Vedanta is a \""foreign company\"" within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1956 and therefore, the Anil Aggarwal-owned company and its subsidiaries, Sterlite and Sesa, are foreign sources as per FCRA. \""Prima facie the acts of the respondents (Congress and BJP) inter se, clearly fall foul of the ban imposed under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act as the donations accepted by the political parties from Sterlite and Sesa accrue from \""foreign sources\"" within the meaning of law,\"" the HC had ruled on a PIL filed by Association for Democratic Reforms.

Comments By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Published:October 14, 2014 1:23 am Senior citizen activists across the state have alleged harassment by the Anti-terrorism Squad, Pune, for arresting and detaining social activists as suspected Naxalites from various social groups. In a letter dated October 12, retired Supreme Court Judge P B Savant, retired Bombay High Court Judge B G Kolse Patil, former Home State Minister Bhai Vaidya, professor Pushpa Bhave, and human rights activist Teesta Setalvad and 15 other activists claim that officials of ATS, Pune, arrested two social activists, Arun Bhelke and Kanchan Nanavare as suspected naxalites in Pune and were made to issue a statement. This statement was allegedly used by ATS to implicate other social activists in this alleged arrest case. The Bharatiya Republican Paksha Bahujan Mahasanghaβ€™s Govandi Corporator Arun Kamble, Republican Pantherβ€™s Jaatiant Movementβ€™s State president, Sharad Gaikwad, Rahul Seva Mandalβ€™s President Shankar Patil, Kabir Kalamachβ€™s Rupali Jadhav from Pune and other activists were allegedly being summoned to the ATS office in Pune for β€inquiryβ€. β€They are made to sit at the office for the entire day after which their statements are recorded. While a person is expected to cooperate with the authorities for an inquiry for a legitimate case, but ordering them to come to Pune every now and then, under the pretext of enquiry and making them confess as per incorrect statements under coercion can be considered as mental harassment of activists in Maharashtra,β€ the letter read. Moreover, the letter alleged that the activists were being forced to disclose names and addresses of other members from the organisations. The letter further mentioned that the Sudhir Dhawle, Editor of Vidrohi (a bimonthly magazine) and member of Republic Panthers was acquitted of charges of Naxalism by a sessions court on 15 May 2014, after 40 months. The letter, howver, alleged that Dhawle continues to face β€harassmentβ€ by the police. The group of complainants demanded for mental harassment of members to be ceased immediately. The activists maintained that citizens are systematically harassed by the police for adhering to a particular ideology. β€We have registered a case based on evidence and investigation as per law is being carried out. We will prove our case in the court of law,β€ said ATS chief Himanshu Roy when contacted. mumbai.newsline@expressindia.com Do you like this story Tags: Anti Terrorism Squad Bombay High Court Home State Minister Bhai Vaidya naxalites
"NEW DELHI: Shadow political battles within the government unsettled North Block yet again, this time claiming the scalp of a strident home secretary whose deepening line of dissent had become a serious cause of worry. Equally surprising was his replacement β€” Rajiv Mehrishi, who until recently manned the other side of the North Block corridor. The dramatic turn of events meant that Home Minister Rajnath Singh has got his third home secretary in 15 months, which has only extended the uncertainty in the ministry. Within hours of the order replacing him as home secretary, Goyal was appointed the chairman & MD of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO). Outgoing home secretary LC Goyal had been chosen just about seven months ago due to his long experience in the ministry, but his tenure was cut short. Goyal told ET he was \not upset\"" with the government. \""I am not upset over anything...I just decided to call it a day. It is a personal decision,\"" he told ET on Monday morning. There were different versions of the reasons behind the decision to replace Goyal, given that Mehrishi is considered close to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who had handpicked him for the job of finance secretary. CHAIN OF EVENTS On the chain of events, reliable sources told ET that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh decided last Friday to replace Goyal. The next day, Singh called Goyal and informed him of the decision in person. Following this, Goyal put in his papers on Sunday and the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) comprising Modi and Rajnath accepted the resignation, issuing orders to this effect on Monday. The government statement said \""Goyal's request for voluntary retirement\"" had been accepted. Goyal's predecessor Anil Goswami was removed in February for allegedly favouring Saradha scam accused Mathang Singh. Mehrishi, who was widely tipped to be the cabinet secretary before he missed out to PK Sinha, was appointed the home secretary on the day he was to retire. He now gets a fixed term for two years. CONTROVERSY OVER SUN TV Goyal had drawn the limelight for voicing dissent on a range of issues. In particular, he had locked horns with the finance ministry (MoF) and the information & broadcasting ministry (MIB) β€” both headed by Jaitley. He refused to budge on his position against giving security clearance to the TV channels and FM stations of Sun Network, a decision that MIB was unhappy with and wanted Goyal to review on many occasions. ET has learnt that after the Delhi High Court gave relief to Sun and allowed it to participate in the FM auctions, MIB had cited the same to PMO. \""In the Sun TV matter, with MIB not issuing any show cause to Sun TV for two months now after MHA's denial of security clearance and Goyal not changing his stand, his position was becoming untenable,\"" a top government official told ET. TROUBLE OVER NAGA ACCORD Home ministry bureaucrats were said to be upset for being kept out of the loop on the Naga peace negotiations, a displeasure that Goyal did not hide in his conversations. Similarly, he had also taken a tough position against MoF for transferring MHA's schemes to states in the Budget and told a parliamentary committee that MHA was never consulted before the step. The development highlighted the differences between the home and finance ministries, with Rajnath taking the matter to the PM. But sources close to the home minister downplayed this. They, in fact, said Singh was \""unhappy\"" with Goyal's \""style of bureaucratic functioning\"" and had complained to the PM about him. Goyal also fell out of favour because of some internal noting he had made critiquing several decisions and processes. \""Goyal was not fitting into the larger scheme of things and insisted on going by the rule book. Decisions were not being taken at his level and matters were pending...in some matters, he did not keep even the home minister in the loop. For example, when Iran was removed from the Prior Reference Category earlier this month, Goyal did not keep Singh in the loop while taking the decision. Senior MHA officers had also complained about Goyal's style of functioning and (that) their suggestions not being taken on board,\"" sources said. RAJNATH HAPPY WITH MEHRISHI They said Singh was \""happy\"" with Mehrishi's appointment as he is \""well-versed\"" about the finance ministry with which the home ministry has to resolve important issues. \""Things may move fast now on finance matters,\"" a home ministry official said. The issue of 'slow action' on the proposed cancellation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act licence of Teesta Setalvad's NGOs is also being cited as a reason by some officials."""
AHMEDABAD: Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have been now charged with forgery and using the forged document as genuine in connection with the case of alleged funds embezzlement. The metropolitan magistrate P K Lodhia on Monday permitted the city crime branch to add sections 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code. This happened after special prosecutor Ajay Choksi submitted that Setalvad's two NGOs β€” Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust β€” used a form of Schedule 9 to fulfill certain requirements under the Bombay Public Charitable Trust Act. But a particular column, which mentions the details of employees and their salaries, was removed from the form. Setalvad and her husband have sought anticipatory bail from the Supreme Court in this case after Gujarat high court in February refused to grant protection against possible arrest. The crime branch has been highlighting how money, which was gathered for the riot victims, was spent on personal luxury from the the NGOs' accounts. In January, an FIR was registered against Setalvad and others for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore collected by them in form of donations for turning the colony into a riots museum. Some former residents of the society alleged that Setalvad and her NGOs restrained them from disposing of their properties after the riots by promising them that the NGOs would purchase them and turn them into a riot memorial. However, the properties were never purchased on the grounds that there was not enough funds. Later, the NGOs and the office-bearers of the society told them that they could sell their houses. They have alleged that Setalvad and her NGOs gathered money from across the world by showing their condition and upon promise that the funds were meant for their uplift. On 28 February, 2002, following the Godhra carnage, sixty-nine persons including former MP Ehsan Jafri were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society.

A magistrate's court here today allowed police to add charges under three forgery-related sections of IPC to the complaint against social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gulberg Society fund embezzlement case. The new charges are under sections 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using a forged document as genuine). On August 3, Ahmedabad police's crime branch had petitioned the court for permission to add these charges to the FIR registered last year. Judge PK Lotiya granted it after a brief hearing today. Sixty nine persons, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, were killed in an attack by a mob on Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad during the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Last January, one of the residents of society, Firoz Khan Pathan, filed a complaint against Ms Setalvad and others that they misused the money collected for building a museum in the memory of riot victims. Ms Setalvad collected Rs 1.51 crore from donors in India and outside but used for personal purposes, says the FIR, filed under IPC sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 406 (fraud) and 420 (cheating).

We are publishing below an Open Letter written by concerned citizens to the Prime Minister opposing the dilution of MNREGA Dear Prime Minister, We are very disturbed by impending moves of this government to undermine the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the support it provides to crores of vulnerable rural families. We write this letter to seek your immediate assurance that these retrograde, anti-poor and anti-labour measures will be withdrawn, and that every attempt will be made by your government to implement the MGNREGA in its true spirit. Based on recent public statements from Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Rural Development, and other available information, we learn that the Central Government has initiated the following changes under MGNREGA: Restriction of NREGA to tribal/backward districts of the country through an amendment to the Act. Reduction of the minimum labour-material ratio from the current level of 60:40 to 51:49. Β Severely restricting the MGNREGA through a budget squeeze. There have been unprecedented communications by the Central Government to States capping MGNREGA expenditure for the rest of the financial year, undermining the fundamental principle of demand-driven employment. These changes are inimical to the spirit of the Act and compromise its basic objectives. They will only benefit the contractor class and other middlemen, and severely undermine the employment generating potential of the MGNREGA. The changes are also being undertaken without any public consultation. The MGNREGA was passed unanimously by all parties and all members of Parliament. We fundamentally object to this critical social legislation being undermined through casual use of executive powers and even a parliamentary majority. The illegal and unwarranted budget squeeze has led to widespread reports of employment rationing and acute delays in wage payments. Even as MGNREGA workers are struggling to be paid for work already done, the Central Government is sending the message that money is going to be further rationed. The undersigned demand that your Government immediately revoke the above decisions and renounce any dilution of MGNREGA. We urge you to ensure that MGNREGA employment remains a legal right of every rural household across the country and that there is no dilution of any MGNREGA entitlements. The MGNREGA budget should be based on work demand, keeping with the spirit of the act, without any discretionary cuts. Through this letter we also wish to convey our resolve to work together to protect the MGNREGA and defend the rights of MGNREGA workers.

Magistrate allows forgery charges against Teesta, husband Ahmedabad, August 11, 2015, dhns: Ahmedabad additional chief metropolitan magistrate on Monday permitted Crime Branch to add IPC sections 467, 468 and 471 against activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, accused of embezzlement.Β  Ahmedabad Crime Branch had early this month requested the Court to allow them to add Section 467 (Forgery), Section 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using a forged document as genuine) in the FIR No-1/2014 filed against the couple. Teesta allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore in funds through her two NGOs β€“ Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice & Peace (CJP) - from domestic and international donors with a promise to convert riot-hit Gulberg society into a museum. Instead, it is alleged that she used the funds for her personal expenses. In 2014, Ahmedabad police registered an FIR following complaints filed by former residents of Gulberg Society a year-and-a-half ago in 2013. The residents apparently claimed that money collected in their name had not reached them. Setalvad on her part stated that since the Gulberg Society survivors would not get a fair price for their flats, Sabrang Trust would try raising funds to build a museum in memorial of the massacre. The CJP, she claimed, had nothing to do with the project. She later said she had to abandon the project as she could only raise Rs 4.6 lakh. As for the Trust funds, she claimed that they had been audited and submitted before the concerned authorities. Go to Top Tweet
Just seven months after he took over as Union Home Secretary, LC Goyal has taken took premature retirement. He was replaced by Finance Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, who was set to retire on Monday. Goyal's tenure was till February 2017 With eyebrows being raised, the government appointed him as CMD of Indian Trade Promotion Organisation within hours. The ITPO's main responsibility is to organise the annual trade fair in Delhi. Mehrishi became the third Home Secretary to be appointed within a year. Goyal was appointed in February after his predecessor Anil Goswami's disgraceful exit due to his links with Saradha scam-accused, Mathang Singh. On Monday afternoon, the Prime Minister's Office issued a press release instead of the Department of Personnel and Training, announcing Goyal's retirement and Mehrishi's appointment. Though Goyal attributed personal reasons for the move, some insiders claim his refusal to give security clearance to Sun Network for its FM and TV channels could be a reason. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry headed by Arun Jaitley was opposed to the Home Ministry's stand on the issue. Others suggested the PMO was unhappy with the speed with which Goyal was working on the FCRA violations case against Teesta Setalvad and her NGOs). The Home Ministry has put Ford Foundation, the key contributor to Setalvad's NGO under the scanner and sent a notice to Sabrang Foundation for violations, but is yet to cancel their licence.
File Photo dna Research & Archives A magistrate's court in Ahmedabad allowed police to add charges under three forgery-related sections of IPC to the complaint against social activist Teesta Setalwad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gulberg Society fund embezzlement case.Β The new charges are under sections 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using a forged document as genuine). On August 3, Ahmedabad police's crime branch had petitioned the court for permission to add these charges to the FIR registered last year. Judge P K Lotiya granted it after a brief hearing today.Β Sixty nine persons, including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, were killed in an attack by a mob on Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad during the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Last January, one of the residents of society, Firoz Khan Pathan, filed a complaint against Setalwad and others that they misused the money collected for building a museum in the memory of riot victims. Setalwad collected Rs 1.51 crore from donors in India and outside but used for personal purposes, says the FIR, filed under IPC sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 406 (fraud) and 420 (cheating).Β 
"Union Home Secretary L C Goyal was Monday replaced after only seven months in office following reported differences with the government and another senior IAS officer Rajiv Mehrishi was appointed in his place on the day of his superannuation. A sudden announcement said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved the appointment of Mehrishi, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, who was due to retire hours later, as Home Secretary for a period of two years. A statement by the PMO also said that the prime minister had also approved the request of Goyal, a 1979-batch IAS officer, whose two-year tenure was till February, 2017, seeking voluntary retirement \due to personal reasons with immediate effect\"". Later in the day, these decisions were attributed to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), which consists of the Prime Minister and Home Minister Rajnath Singh. In the evening, another official announcement said that Modi had approved the appointment of Goyal as Chairman and Managing Director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO). Amid reports that Goyal had differences with the government on certain key issues including the recent Naga accord, the officer maintained that he was not upset with the government and that his decision to take voluntary retirement was personal. \""It was my own decision,\"" Goyal said, adding that any other reason being mentioned was \""factually incorrect\"". However, the change of the Home Secretary comes against the backdrop of controversies involving the home ministry with regard to denial of security clearance to SUN TV owned by the Maran group, issues related to an NGO headed by activist Teesta Setalvad and the Naga accord. Goyal had taken over as Home Secretary nearly seven months ago on February 5 when the then incumbent Anil Goswami was virtually sacked after he allegedly tried to prevent CBI from arresting former Union Minister Matang Sinh in connection with Saradha chit fund scam case. This is the third exit of a top bureaucrat much before the end of tenure. Apart from Goswami, Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh was eased out of her office in January, six months before the completion of her two-year fixed tenure. The post of Union Home Secretary has a fixed tenure of two years.Β """
"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court will hear the anticipatory bail applications filed by activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand on Tuesday. Last month on July 24, the HC had granted interim protection to the duo, after a special CBI court rejected their anticipatory bail plea. The court had then asked the couple to attend the CBI office for investigation purposes on four specific days. The CBI is investigating allegations that the couple violated the FCRA regulations for receiving $ 2,90,000 from Ford Foundation between 2004 and 2008, without prior permission from the Centre.

[We are reproducing below a letter to the NHRC Chairperson by Teesta Setalvad, Secretary, Citizens for Justice and Peace, Mumbai] October 6, 2014 To the Chairperson Mr Balakrishnan,Β National Human Rights Commission. Dear Sir, There are extremely disturbing reports about the climate of abject fear that the poor and marginalised communitoies of JJ Colony, Bawana are living in, following recent incidents. Prominent residents of Delhi have carried out an independent fact finding into allegations of cow slaughter and the systematic intimidation of local Muslims. The team consisting of Dr. Mrigank (Delhi Committee, Indian Federation of Trade Unions, IFTU), Poonam Kaushik (Gen. Secy. Pragatisheel Mahila Sangathan, PMS), Rajeev (Convener, Progressive Democratic Studentsβ€™ Union, PDSU) visited JJ Colony Bawana. This report available here. We urge Sir that the National Human Rights Commission carries out a suo moto inquiry into the incident and especially inquires into the following;- From the above Report (see below) the observations made are : 1. That the allegations that there is plan of cow slaughter is bogus. There is no possibility of hiding the cows. And no cows were found. 2. That there is intimidation of Muslims and they are living amidst fear. The police protection is not enough. 3. That the organizations like Hindu Krantikari Sena are not spontaneous organizations. It is clears from the fact that among the main organizer was the nephew of BJP MLA. Also total inactivity of BJP MP is a clear indication. 4. That there is total communal harmony in JJ Colony and even today they are together. It is demanded that: 1. There should be enough police protection to prevent any untoward incident. There are about 15 places of sacrifice. Police should be deployed there also to prevent any mis-happenings. 2. The people inciting, and spreading rumours should be arrested, booked. 3. Cases should be registered on the people who were involved in beating, stone pelting and guilty policemen should also be booked. Sir we urge that you look into these observations of the Independent report that is enclosed below.

By Irfan Engineer, Media reported that about 8000 people attended the last journey of Yakub Memon β€“ whom the Supreme Court had earlier convicted for the offence of being part of conspiracy to plant bombs in various places in Mumbai on 12th March 1993. 257 innocent lives were lost. Yakub Memon and was hanged to death on of 30th July 2015. Social media expressed their anguish towards those who attended the funeral in particular and the Muslim community in general. Some opined that the community was not willing to accept the conviction of Yakub by the Supreme Court while others insinuated that the attendees were supporters of terrorists and anti-national. Tripura Governor Tathagatha Roy tweeted that all those who attended the funeral, except family members of Yakub Memon, were potential terrorists. We need to understand why there was such a huge turnout for Yakub Memonβ€™s last rites. There is no denying that a section of Muslims empathised with Yakub. However that cannot be read as support for terrorism or terrorists of any hue or colour. The community knows the pain losing loved ones to hate crimes. After the 26/11/2008 attack by 10 Pakistani terrorists, including Ajmal Kasab, in which 164 people were killed, the Indian Muslim community refused burial for the 9 terrorists gunned down by the security personnel. Muslim organisations in Mumbai had announced that the doors of the cemeteries in which unclaimed bodies are usually buried will not open for the terrorists, as they were not the true followers of Islam (PTI, 2010). This is not the first time that people have empathised with a criminal by attending his last rites. Large numbers of people turn out for dons belonging to various castes, ethnic and religious background. Those who attended the last rites of Phoolan Devi, were not necessarily insensitive toward the victims of her numerous dacoities. They perhaps remembered that she too was victim of caste oppression even though she may have chosen wrong method to fight it. They identified with her victimhood and were inspired by her courage to fight back β€“ not necessarily with the means she chose. No one said at that time that all those attending Phoolan Deviβ€™s last rites, except her family members, were potential dacoits. Many people, particularly Tamils in Dharavi, mourned the death of the gangster Vardarajan Mudaliar β€“ contract killer in Mumbai (Wikipedia, n.d.). The mourners were not mourning loss of a contract killer. Nearly 1.2 million people took part in the funeral procession of Bal Thackeray covering six km in just over five hours, forcing the police to shut down large parts of the city to traffic (ET Bureau, 2012). Bal Thackeray was condemned by Justice Madon Commission for his role in 1970 communal riots in Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad, and by Justice Srikrishna Commission for the riots 1992-93 communal riots in Mumbai. Srikrishna Commission found Bal Thackeray riding into the boiling cauldron that Mumbai was after the demolition of Babri Masjid β€like a veteran general leading his troops.β€ It is a different matter that no efforts were made to bring Bal Thackeray to justice for his inflammatory hate speeches against Muslims and non-Maharashtrians and for leading his troops like a veteran general in riots. Bal Thackerayβ€™s sainiks would be ready to execute any orders from him β€“ kill trade union leaders, attack non-Maharashtrians, cinema halls, media offices and use strong arm tactics. He proudly proclaimed that he did not believe in lokshahi (democracy) but thokshahi (strong arm and coercion). All his thokshahi was while he was enjoying Z plus category security cover. Officially 900 people were killed in Mumbai 1992-93 communal riots, 575 of them were Muslims, 275 Hindus and 50 others (Nayar, 2015). Bal Thackeray was indicted by Justice Srikrishna Commission (Justice Srikrishna, 1998). Empathy with persons in conflict with law There are three reasons for empathy with persons in conflict with law (pcwl). One β€“ of course, family members, even if disapproving the activity of the person could have empathy or at least a humanitarian duty of participating in the last rites of the person. Two β€“ when people value contribution of the pcwl to their lives and their deeds perceived as heroic. Three β€“ empathizers share the socio-economic background with the pcwl, particularly, those from the marginalized and oppressed sections like the oppressed and marginalised castes, ethnic groups or minority communities. They understand why the pcwl had to adopt means that were in conflict with law when they themselves experience powerlessness, subjugation, exploitation and marginalization within the legal framework. The pcwl to some extent limits and resists the power of their oppressors. People attending Phoolan Deviβ€™s funeral empathized with her for this reason. The pcwl also share some of her/his booty with the needy among his/her marginalized community and in turn enjoys their support. Arun Gawli, from an OBC caste, was popular among the residents of Dagdi Chawl, Vardarajan was popular in Dharavi among the otherwise marginalized Tamil community largely drawn from SC and OBC castes. The pcwls from marginalised sections are more like Robinhoods. They do not affect the structures of oppression, exploitation and marginalization. They ensure only a sense of honour and dignity and semblance of counter power and minor economic gains β€“ e.g. marginal increase in wages or end to unpaid work for feudal oppressors, or employment in the pcwlβ€™s occupation. The pcwls from the marginalized community cannot sustain themselves for long without finding for themselves safe havens in forests or ultimately end up working for the interest of dominant elite. The smugglers end up benefiting the industrialist and builders benefit from the land mafia. Muslim Youth Continuous exclusion, discrimination, lack of educational and livelihood opportunities, communal violence and marginalization, did lead to some Muslim youth too to be in conflict with law. Attack on sacred symbols and beliefs (claim to 3,000 mosques where temples existed) and subjugating them to brutal display of force and violence shakes their sense of self and community; shakes the foundation of their human existence. A survivor in Muzaffarnagar started crying like a child seeing their mosque burnt down and told this writer he would never be able to return to the village where the mosque was burnt, it just did not make any sense, nor there would be any dignity left in doing so. In Atali village, Ballabhgarh, Haryana, the community was not allowed to put a roof over the place where they were praying for over 50 years! These are just not isolated examples. There have been numerous cases all over the country. Stigmatized for conducting β€love jihadβ€, being terrorists, for the dress they wear, food they eat etc. and numerous leaders of Hindu nationalist organisations reminding Muslims that Gujarat and Muzaffarnagar can occur again. There is no hope of justice to the survivors of communal violence which has consumed 40,000 lives in independent India, including Mumbai, Bhiwandi, Ahmedabad, Meerut, Aligarh, Moradabad, Godhara, Sitamarhi, Bhagalpur, Nellie, and numerous other places. When a human rights activist like Teesta Setalvad struggles for justice to survivors of 2002 riots in Gujarat, the entire state tries to put her behind bars and calls her enemy of the state. The community had its Haji Mastan, Karim Lala, Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon and others. There is no gainsaying that all the Muslim youth accused by the security forces of terrorist activities are innocent. Conversely all of them are not guilty just because security forces have accused them to be terrorists. A large number of innocent youth are arrested accused of terror for ulterior motives and suffer incarceration for years together without bail as they are charged under draconian laws without any legal justification only to be discharged by courts as innocents. They return losing their prime years to a world of stigma and unemployment, sometimes forced out of professional courses they were pursuing at the time of their arrest. When the community loses hopes for justice, a few youth take upon themselves to dispense justice outside the legal framework. Their conflict with law is without any disapproval of the community. A section of the community even empathizes with them. The survivors of communal violence did not get justice even when β€secularβ€ parties claiming to oppose communal politics like the Congress, RJD, SP and numerous others were at the helm. On the other hand, Hindu nationalist organizations and leaders of the BJP are aggressively communalizing the public discourse. The Muslim community, in spite of its sectoral, caste and biradari based, linguistic, cultural, jurisprudential and other diversities, divisions and political conflicts, feel under siege and there is an urge to unite politically and have a strong leader who would deliver justice β€“ social, political and economic. Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM is trying to benefit from the situation and emerge as a β€strong leaderβ€™ of the community and its sole spokesperson by cleverly choosing his discourse that sounds to be within the Constitutional framework and yet exploiting the victimhood feeling within the community. He targets and opposes every party that vie for support of the Muslim community. His political ambitions are to expand his party from Hyderabad based to an all India party and to mobilize all Muslim votes displacing the existing Muslim interest parties as well as other secular parties. Uniting the community under a Muslim interest party would serve the purpose of the Hindu nationalist organizations on one hand and the Muslim political elite belonging to ashraf biradaries (upper caste) on the other hand. Mobilization of Muslims on communal agenda pushes the Constitutional agenda of equality and social justice β€“ empowerment of socially and educationally backward classes to the margins and makes it irrelevant. Large turnout Large turnout for Yakub Memon should be seen in this light. It would be a travesty of truth to read the turnout as support for the March 12, 1993 bombings in which 257 innocent people died or any insensitivity to the survivors of the bombings. There should not be any doubt that all those who were part of Yakub Memonβ€™s funeral wanted all the guilty of the March 12 1993 bombings to be punished, including Yakub Memon. They believed that death penalty was excessive for the offence he committed and that there were extenuating circumstances. There were many non-Muslims too who believed that Yakub did not deserve death penalty for his crime. The media carried two versions. Those against capital punishment were presenting their β€evidenceβ€ and arguments that Yakub Memon surrendered himself and disclosed to the investigation agencies all material particulars about the conspiracy. He therefore deserved lenient punishment. Whereas those supporting the capital punishment to Yakub Memon would argue that someone should be held accountable for the killing 257 innocent persons in the March 12 bombings in Mumbai and handed deterrent punishment; and that Yakub Memon being one of the conspirers deserved the punishment. When a significantly large number of Indians, irrespective of their religion and community held the opinion that Yakub should not have been hanged, why single out Muslims on the basis of their religion for holding such an opinion? If the idea of India has to survive and the Constitutional vision has to survive, all Indians will have to come together build robust institutions for dispensing justice that is community, caste, nationality, ethnicity, gender and linguistic neutral; build institutions that privilege the socially and educationally backward irrespective of religion, gender, caste, ethnicity, but is not blind if injustices, exclusion, oppression and marginalization is being targeted against particular gender, caste, community, ethnicity, religion and nationality. We need to build accountable and responsible governance and participatory democracy. It is a just society that reduces crime. Victimization only produces β€heroesβ€ and a cycle of violence and counter violence no matter what deterrent punishment is handed out. β€¦β€¦.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken 15 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) under its scanner for allegedly violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and may register cases against them soon. Confirming the information, a CBI source said the agencyβ€™s initial probe is based on the reference received from the central government on the 15 NGOs, who are suspected of having violated FCRA provisions. There were β€adverse reportsβ€ against the NGOs after alleged irregularities were found in their accounts during β€inspections and scrutiny,β€ said the source. β€We are scrutinising details, including financial records pertaining to the 15 NGOs under the scanner,β€ said the source. Cases pertaining to 10 other NGOs to state police agencies for further action by the government, even as accounts of 23 other NGOs were frozen as part of the crackdown on alleged FCRA violators. The source did not reveal the names of the NGOs on grounds that the verifications are still underway. The CBIβ€™s move against the NGOs comes over a month after it began a probe against Mumbai-based social activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s company Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL) and three of its directors, for alleged acceptance of foreign contributions without registration and prior permission from the home ministry. Setalvad has however denied the allegations, claiming no rules were violated.

Amnesty International India has said that the investigations against the Civil rights activists Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand are politically motivated, and made with the intention of persecuting them for their human rights work. Civil rights activists Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand are at risk of being arrested and placed in police custody on allegations of conspiracy and illegal acceptance of foreign donations. Amnesty International India believes they are being targeted for their work in seeking justice for the victims of the 2002 violence in Gujarat. Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have been working for several years to secure justice for the victims and survivors of the 2002 violence in the state of Gujarat, through the organizations Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL). The month-long outbreak of violence in 2002 led to the killing, according to official estimates, of at least 1044 people, mostly Muslims, and the rape of a significant number of women and girls. Their work has been instrumental in bringing about over a hundred convictions in cases related to the 2002 killings. The CJP has also sought the prosecution of several other Gujarat and central government officials and politicians for their alleged complicity in the violence. On 8 July, the Central Bureau of Investigation, a central investigating agency, registered a case against Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand. The CBI alleged that SCPPL, by receiving about 18 million INR from the Ford Foundation without the prior approval of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, had violated Indiaβ€™s Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), which restricts civil society organizations from receiving foreign funding. The CBI said the transfer of the money to the publishing house reflected β€interference towards the internal security and activities of Indiaβ€. Amnesty International India believes the investigations against the activists to be politically motivated, and made with the intention of persecuting them for their human rights work. Teesta Setalvad has pointed out that her publishing house had a consultancy contract with the Ford Foundation, which excluded it from the restrictions of the FCRA. Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand have rebutted the allegations against them in detail in affidavits produced in court. The financial accounts of NGOs run by them have been audited and submitted to the appropriate Indian authorities.
Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Friday granted protection from arrest for two weeks to activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband, hours after a lower court denied them anticipatory bail amid accusations that their NGO received funds from the United States-based Ford Foundation without government authorisation. Setalvad, a long-time critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said she was being persecuted by the government for her campaign against the Gujarat riots of 2002 when the BJP leader was chief minister. β€I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic),β€ she said after the sessions court rejected her bail application. The coupleβ€™s lawyers approached the high court anticipating arrest for custodial interrogation sought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The agency registered a case against Setalvad and her husband, Javed Anand, on July 8 and raided their home and offices a week later. A bank account of the NGO, Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd located in Mumbai, was frozen on the instructions of the home ministry. Sources said documents recovered by the agency appeared to support its allegations. The activist recently said she was cooperating with the CBI and her organisationβ€™s arrangement with the Ford Foundation was permitted under law, while she panned the investigating agency for calling her a β€national threatβ€. Setalvad has also been accused by Gujarat police of using funds meant for victims of the Gujarat riots on purchasing wine and expensive mobile phones, apart from tampering with evidence.

"A sessions court today rejected the anticipatory bail plea filed by social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, in connection with a case of foreign donations to her NGO in alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Soon after the decision, Setalvad has moved the Bombay High Court for the same. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against Setalvad and her husband Javed on July 8 and raided their home and offices on July 14. The agency is looking into whether Setalvad's NGO Sabrang received funding from the United States-based Ford Foundation without government permission. \I am shocked and aggrieved. My sympathisers believe that it's a move to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the power,\"" Teesta said after the sessions court hearing. The CBI prosecutor had opposed their plea on the ground that it was a serious crime that requires their custodial interrogation. The FIR registered by the CBI is against Directors of Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd Setalvad, her husband Javed and Peshimam Gulam Mohammed for alleged violation of provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act by conspiring to receive funds from abroad, without permission from theHome ministry. Mihir Desai, Counsel for Teesta and Anand said no arrest or custody was necessary in a case like this, especially since she had already written to the agency offering to cooperate with all documents and files they need to look at. The case is that Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) run by Teesta and her husband were running Communalism Combat, a magazine which they co-edited and published with foreign funding. The new law prohibits receipt of foreign funding by editors, columnist, correspondents, printers or publishers of a paper. The Home Ministry's case is that of an alleged fund over Rs 1.15 crore was received between 2009 and 2013, most of which was spent on legal aid, not \""educational and economic\"" purpose, which the funds were received for.

"Mumbai: Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband were on Friday granted interim protection from arrest after they filed anticipatory bail plea in a court in Mumbai in connection with a case of alleged violation of foreign funding norms by her publishing company.CBI has alleged that Setalvad's company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without approval of the Union Government.Special CBI Judge Anis Khan reserved the order on the bail application till Tuesday and granted Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand interim protection from arrest.The court directed the couple, who has termed the case as \false\"" and smacking of \""political vendetta\"", to appear before CBI every day till Tuesday.The Central agency on 8 July registered a case against Setalvad and Anand alleging her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) received around USD 2.9 lakh (Rs 1.8 crore) in donations from overseas in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the said amount was, therefore, received in violation of the Act under which the firm needed to seek prior approval from the Home Ministry.Setalvad and her husband, through their lawyer, told the court they were innocent and have been falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai argued that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them is to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat.However, CBI said motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected \""interference towards the internal security and activities of India\"".\""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI said in their reply while opposing the application.The reply further read that the allegations against the couple (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation.PTI"""
New Delhi:Β Expressing their solidarity with activist Teesta Setalvad, several opposition MPs including Ghulam Nabi Azad of Congress and Sharad Yadav of JD(U) today accused the Centre of β€subjecting her to the worst kind of harassmentβ€ to silence voices of dissent.

"By Sandip Roy and Lakshmi Chaudhry Making her first speech as the newly anointed UN Goodwill Ambassador, actor Emma Watson noted that at the age of 18, \I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word.\"" She was immediately targeted by what appeared to be 4Chan trolls but now it seems to be social media company called Rantic which made the site as a way to shut down 4Chan. Others posted false reports of her death. At around the same time, in a galaxy far, far away, actor Joseph Gordon Levitt decided to release a cool little video about feminism, sparked by his recent admission on the Ellen DeGeneres show that he is, gasp, a feminist. No threats, serious or otherwise, were made. Apparently, the sexist double standard applies in all matters, including feminism. As Watson mildly noted, the f-word is indeed \""unpopular\"" these days, but it entails a number of hazards for woman. Here then are five other reasons why it is always easier for a man to come out of as a feminist. You are not constantly threatened or vilified When activist Kavita Krishnan went on a Rediff.com live chat to discuss anti-rape protests, she was threatened by someone who wanted to come rape her using a condom. No one is threatening any such dire consequences for Joseph Gordon-Leavitt. Neither did anyone threaten to leak Farhan Akhtarβ€™s nude pictures to the world for his MARD campaign. Or call him a feminazi. β€Be a catalyst for change, empowering women, empowering humanity,β€ says Farhan Akhtar with blithe abandon in his He For She video But when Emma Watson had the temerity to ask men to join the HeForShe campaign, a group called Women Against Feminism tweeted 'BURN THE WITCH'. A feminist protester in Paris. Reuters When a woman is feminist sheβ€™s regarded not as someone who wants equal pay for equal work but as one of β€a load of strident bitchesβ€ says Susan Sarandon. Thatβ€™s why Sarandon would rather think of herself as a β€humanistβ€ not an β€old-fashionedβ€ feminist. Humanist is the kinder, gentler version who a man is allowed to flirt with. All that 'feminist' earns a woman is instant and constant abuse. It doesn't make you instantly ugly. When Huma Qureshi showed up on the cover of Femina behind the message I Donβ€™t Owe You Perfection! My Body, My Rules it became the toast of social media for breaking the patriarchal tyranny of the mannequin body. But asked on NDTV if she was one of β€those feministsβ€ who donβ€™t believe in chivalry she was quick to say β€I am not a feminist. I am an equalist for sure.β€ Itβ€™s one thing to be full-figured and have a Bollywood career, and quite another for a feminist to aspire to stardom. So it is that Madhuri Dixit can wax eloquent on womenβ€™s empowerment and why she does a film like Gulaab Gang but sheβ€™s quick to clarify sheβ€™s not a feminist, just β€independent and strongβ€. The F-word apparently is the equivalent of having garlic breath. No one will think Gordon-Leavitt will skip on the cologne after coming out as a feminist but any woman who calls herself one conjures up images of hairy armpits, unthreaded upper lips, and no vanity bag within thirty yards. The 'feminist' label is the quickest route to female celibacy, but for men it just adds a little dimple to that sensitivity factor. No one assumes you hate men β€Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men and, unattractive,β€ says Emma Watson. She could have added lesbian to the stereotype soup. For as we all well know, lesbians haaaate men. (sarcasm alert) Hence, endorsing anything that even vaguely endorses 'girl power' requires a hasty qualification. So it Katy Perry insisted, β€I am not feminist but I do believe in the power of women.β€ To her credit, she later acknowledged that she is a feminist but made sure we all know that β€it just means that I love myself as a female and I also love men.β€ Gordon-Levitt will not have to love himself into a pretzel and coin words like \""equalist\"" to be a feminist. When he says heβ€™s a feminist, he is being inclusive. He loves everybody. Both Watson and he have made clear that they define feminism as equality, but only one is assumed to be a man-hating cow. Mamata Banerjee, for all her fire-breathing antics, wanted her audience at a NewsLaundry event to know β€But I am not a feminist,β€ and for good reason. No politician can afford to be suspected of disliking one half of her potential voters. Even Brinda Karat says she is an β€activistβ€ not a feminist and the days of putting up β€womenβ€™s only signsβ€ are over. You donβ€™t have to risk losing your feminist card for the slightest slip Shabana Azmi might have no problems calling herself a β€feministβ€ but many of her peers felt she let them all down by marrying the already-married Javed Akhtar. Smita Patil faced similar ire for falling in love with a married man as well and was labeled a β€home-breakerβ€ by some of the organisations she had worked assiduously for. A womanβ€™s feminist credentials are always at risk and the slightest slip means your feminist card will be revoked by other self-proclaimed card-carrying feminists. What? You think drag is funny? You danced to choli ke peechhey? Off with your head. Donβ€™t even hum a Honey Singh song in the shower. While Indian Twitter may not have experienced American-style feminist wars , misogyny has become the favourite charge leveled at women writers the moment they criticise a female personality. So knocking Smriti Irani can earn a woman the self-righteous wrath of BJP supporters, while a negative assessment of Sonia Gandhi can transform her into a strong woman-hating right-winger. You are not accountable for what every other feminist says or does If a woman dares to call herself a feminist she must be prepared to defend Arundhati Royβ€™s stance of Maoists, Naomi Wolf on motherhood, and Teesta Setalvad on Gujarat. If Germaine Greer or Gloria Steinem changes her mind about the virtues of the traditional family, the feminist woman must respond whether or not she agrees with Gloria Steinem or Greer. A woman who identifies with the F-word is immediately regarded as part of an inflexible iron-clad contract-bound sisterhood which has to march in lock step on every issue from a womanβ€™s right to choose to the invasion of Iraq. Worse, she is now accountable for the words and actions of every feminist group or leader. Gordon-Leavitt will not be regarded as hypocritical for having no opinion on the burqa but an Emma Watson had better have her answer prepped. Look at those Indian feminists up in arms about gang-rapes in Bharat and so quiet about what the Islamic State fighters are doing to women in Iraq. Arundhati Roy thinks 'terrorists' represent the \""biggest feminist movement in India\"". What do 'you feminists' -- ladies only, please! -- have to say about that, huh?"""
"Barely a week after former Gujarat city court judge Himanshu Trivedi lent his support to activist Teesta Setalvad in a Facebook post, he claims he has started receiving veiled threats and abuse on social media. Trivedi, aΒ judge who resigned from Ahmedabadβ€™s City Civil and Sessions Court in 2003 and now lives in New Zealand, wrote a Facebook post on August 1 applauding Setalvad and her work to fight for justice for the victims of the communal violence in Gujarat in 2002. Since then, his post has hit the headlines for his claims that β€the state of Gujarat wanted us (the judges and the judiciary of Gujarat) to be acting against the minority community (albeit with no written orders but DEFINITELY communicated in loud and clear messages to us)β€. One of Trivediβ€™s reasons for quitting the judiciary, he says, was because he was β€sworn to the Constitution of Indiaβ€ and could not in good faith participate in these actions. Trivedi was a colleague of Jyotsna Yagnik, the special court judge who in 2012 convicted Gujarati minister Maya Kodnani and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi for violence during the riots. Since then, she has received several threatening letters and menacing phone calls. Trivedi describes Yagnik as a β€wonderful human beingβ€ who believed in always being β€legal and righteousβ€. In a phone interview with Scroll.in from Auckland, New Zealand, Trivedi revealed details about his experiences during and after the communal riots that shook his faith in the justice system: he not only witnessed police complicity in the attack on Muslims, but also saw lawyers and judges display extremely prejudiced opinions. β€I have been saying all of this for ten years, but there were no listeners earlier,β€ said Trivedi, who is happy that his attempt to reach out to Setalvad has drawn attention to his story and the issue of compromised justice in the case of the Gujarat riots. β€I have supported Teesta because I believe in supporting anyone working for humanity.β€ Despite the online threats he is now allegedly receiving, Trivedi has declared in a new Facebook post that he will not shut down his social media account or stay silent in the face of \fascist forces\"". Passion for theatre Trivedi comes from a family of lawyers, but unlike his father and grandfather, his first love was always acting and theatre. He had performed in several Gujarati plays in college and after graduating law school in 1985, he moved to Mumbai to pursue theatre. In 1986, to make ends meet, he joined Gujarat Samachar as a reporter and sub-editor. One of his first assignments was to cover proceedings of the Justice Lentin CommissionΒ that had inquired into the deaths of 14 people at JJ Hospital that year after they were administered contaminated glycerol. β€That is when I fell in love with law all over again,β€ said Trivedi, who began looking for opportunities as a lawyer. β€I got an offer to join a Gujarati law firm in Mumbai, but on the condition that I would give up theatre.β€ This, Trivedi refused to do. Instead, he moved to Ahmedabad and chose to join his father, an established lawyer with his own firm. He worked on civil cases in the City Civil and Sessions Court, while remaining attached to a local theatre group. β€But gradually, I got more and more involved with legal work and by 1999, I was a complete lawyer,β€ he said. Trivedi did work on a few criminal cases during his years as a lawyer, but tried to stay away from them as much as possible. β€I have always felt conflicted about criminal law,\"" he said. \""If an innocent client is punished, or a guilty one let off, I would have deep problems with it.β€ β€I saw the police hand out inflammable materialβ€™ The riots of 2002 began on February 28, one day after the Godhra train burning incident that killed 59 people. On the morning of the riots, Trivediβ€™s family heard some noises from the street outside their building. He went with his young daughter to the balcony and witnessed a mob of around 40 people attacking a small dhobiΒ shop run by a Muslim. β€It was the only shop targeted in our area, and the crowd first looted it,\"" said Trivedi. \""Then I saw a police jeep approach and officers in uniform distributed inflammable material to the crowd. Then the shop was burnt.β€ He felt helpless, but didnβ€™t figure out the implications of what he saw till a couple of weeks later, when one of his friends came to visit him. β€My friend and I were sitting on my terrace, talking about the riots and how society was suffering, when he suddenly started crying,β€ said Trivedi. β€Everyone knew that I had always been politically unaffiliated, but that day my friend told me for the first time that he was the president of VHP chapter in a suburb of Ahmedabad.β€ Trivediβ€™s friend β€“ whom he did not wish to name β€“ said that on the day of the riots, he was part of crowd that torched a Muslim-run restaurant opposite the High Court judgesβ€™ bungalows area. β€He told me that they knew it was run by Muslims because three months before the violence, lists were distributed detailing who works where and who lives where,β€ said Trivedi. In a report on the Gujarat carnage published in Outlook by an independent fact-finding team, the establishment in question has been identified as Tasty restaurant. \""Despite the presence of a large police force, including members of the State Reserve Police in the area, various incidents of looting and arson had taken place including the burning of a Muslim owned restaurant, 'Tasty', in front of the block where the Chief Justice's residence is located,\"" the report says. β€I asked my friend, werenβ€™t you afraid of the police in the chowkie right across from the restaurant?\"" Trivedi said. \""He replied that they were told nobody would stop them for 72 hours.\"" This is when Trivedi β€connected the dotsβ€ between the police jeep he saw outside his balcony and the complicity of the authorities that the VHP had allegedly been assured of. β€This same thing has been repeated by IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt,β€ he said. In the burning of Tasty restaurant, three young boys β€“ kitchen-hands who happened to be Hindu β€“ allegedly died of suffocation. β€My friend was crying because he didnβ€™t know there would be people inside the restaurant, and he felt guilty even though he wasnβ€™t the one who actually set the fire,β€ he said. Saffron prosecutors, judges with tilaks In October 2002, eight months after the communal riots of February, Trivedi was appointed as a judge in the Civil and Sessions Court. But neither his decision to join the judiciary, nor his choice to leave it, were directly related to the riots. β€I joined the judiciary because I wanted to serve society in a better way,β€ said Trivedi, who handled only civil matters during his eight months of working as a judge. At that stage, all riot-related cases were being heard in the lower metropolitan magistrate courts. But for several months, the effects of the communal violence could be felt everywhere, even among lawyers and judges in the City Court. β€In the judgesβ€™ tea room in court, I would often hear senior colleagues discussing the riots and whether β€theyβ€™ [Muslims] needed to be taught a lesson,β€ said Trivedi, who claims there were sporadic incidents of judges facing direct pressure from anti-Muslim elements, although he never faced any himself. β€But the indirect pressure was everywhere β€“ you could feel in the tense air all through Gujarat in those months.β€ After the riots, says Trivedi, crowds would often celebrate the fact that they had β€taught Muslims a lessonβ€ and that they would also isolate the minority community economically. β€In the compounds of the court, many lawyers also talked in the same vein,β€ he said. The atmosphere was so polarised that voicing any moderate views could invite abuse. β€If anyone said that killing is just wrong, and that rioters have no religion, people would ask you to β€go to Pakistanβ€™. I myself have faced such abuse.β€ In court, Trivedi claims, the public prosecutors in almost all the riot-related cases were people from the β€saffron side of the political spectrumβ€ β€“ either members of the Bajrang Dal, VHP or BJP, or people closely associated with these groups. β€They had been appointed by the government to prosecute the perpetrators of the violence, who were their own people.β€ Trivedi was also disturbed by the behaviour of some members of the judiciary. β€There were judges who wore their religious symbols while sitting on the dais,\"" he said. \""If you were a Muslim riot survivor giving a statement in court, how comfortable would you feel if the judge sat with a tilak on his forehead?β€ In many ways, it was clear to Trivedi that judicial impartiality was being compromised in court. β€A judge once asked me, donβ€™t you think the Muslim bad elements need to be punished?\"" he recalled. \""I asked her if she meant judicial punishment based on evidence or extra-judicial punishment. And she said that sometimes, one has to turn a blind eye to reactionary, vigilante justice.β€ Leaving the judiciary For Trivedi, the immediate trigger for quitting his post as a judge was a tiff with the Gujarat High Court. Barely a month after he assumed his duties, he received a written warning from the High Court for failing to wrap up a property dispute matter by September 2002, even though he became a judge only in October. A disagreement ensued when he tried to point this out, and Trivedi decided he didnβ€™t want to be part of a system in which the lower judiciary always live in fear of the higher judiciary. β€But it was also a cumulative anger β€“ after the riots and the clear saffronisation of the prosecutors, I felt like all the lines between the legislative, the executive and the judiciary were blurred, and I wasnβ€™t sure whom I was working for,β€ he said. After resigning in April 2003, Trivedi went back to practicing law in other courts for around eight months, but moved to New Zealand in April 2004. β€I was sick and tired of a society that was so angry and hateful, and I wanted to get my daughter out of that atmosphere,β€ he said. Trivedi now works as a solicitor with a law firm in Auckland. """
Ahmedabad: The Gujarat High Court on Friday asked social activist Teesta Setalvad, who had filed a petition seeking exemption from regular appearance at police station in a case related to an allegedly objectionable tweet, to approach the sessions court. Justice Mohinder Pal disposed of her petition. Setalvad had sought exemption from appearing in person at the Ghatlodia police station here on the fifth of every month, as directed by the sessions court. An FIR was filed against Setalvad last year on the complaint of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist for uploading `objectionable' pictures of Hindu deities on Twitter. The case was lodged under IPC sections 153(a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups) and 205(a) (outraging religious feelings) and also under IT Act. Setalvad had tweeted a photo-shopped picture of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) terrorist which also featured Hindu deities. She later removed the picture. The activist, who has crossed swords with BJP government in Gujarat in the past over the probe of 2002 Gujarat riots, sought pre-arrest bail from the sessions court.

By Irfan Engineer Media reported that about 8000 people attended the last journey of Yakub Memon β€“ whom the Supreme Court had earlier convicted for the offence of being part of conspiracy to plant bombs in various places in Mumbai on 12th March 1993. 257 innocent lives were lost. Yakub Memon and was hanged to death on of 30th July 2015. Social media expressed their anguish towards those who attended the funeral in particular and the Muslim community in general. Some opined that the community was not willing to accept the conviction of Yakub by the Supreme Court while others insinuated that the attendees were supporters of terrorists and anti-national. Tripura Governor Tathagatha Roy tweeted that all those who attended the funeral, except family members of Yakub Memon, were potential terrorists. We need to understand why there was such a huge turnout for Yakub Memonβ€™s last rites. There is no denying that a section of Muslims empathised with Yakub. However that cannot be read as support for terrorism or terrorists of any hue or colour. The community knows the pain losing loved ones to hate crimes. After the 26/11/2008 attack by 10 Pakistani terrorists, including Ajmal Kasab, in which 164 people were killed, the Indian Muslim community refused burial for the 9 terrorists gunned down by the security personnel. Muslim organisations in Mumbai had announced that the doors of the cemeteries in which unclaimed bodies are usually buried will not open for the terrorists, as they were not the true followers of IslamΒ (PTI, 2010). This is not the first time that people have empathised with a criminal by attending his last rites. Large numbers of people turn out for dons belonging to various castes, ethnic and religious background. Those who attended the last rites of Phoolan Devi, were not necessarily insensitive toward the victims of her numerous dacoities. They perhaps remembered that she too was victim of caste oppression even though she may have chosen wrong method to fight it. They identified with her victimhood and were inspired by her courage to fight back β€“ not necessarily with the means she chose. No one said at that time that all those attending Phoolan Deviβ€™s last rites, except her family members, were potential dacoits. Many people, particularly Tamils in Dharavi, mourned the death of the gangster Vardarajan Mudaliar β€“ contract killer in Mumbai (Wikipedia, n.d.). The mourners were not mourning loss of a contract killer. Nearly 1.2 million people took part in the funeral procession of Bal Thackeray covering six km in just over five hours, forcing the police to shut down large parts of the city to trafficΒ (ET Bureau, 2012). Bal Thackeray was condemned by Justice Madon Commission for his role in 1970 communal riots in Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad, and by Justice Srikrishna Commission for the riots 1992-93 communal riots in Mumbai. Srikrishna Commission found Bal Thackeray riding into the boiling cauldron that Mumbai was after the demolition of Babri Masjid β€like a veteran general leading his troops.β€ It is a different matter that no efforts were made to bring Bal Thackeray to justice for his inflammatory hate speeches against Muslims and non-Maharashtrians and for leading his troops like a veteran general in riots. Bal Thackerayβ€™s sainiks would be ready to execute any orders from him β€“ kill trade union leaders, attack non-Maharashtrians, cinema halls, media offices and use strong arm tactics. He proudly proclaimed that he did not believe in lokshahi (democracy) but thokshahi (strong arm and coercion). All his thokshahi was while he was enjoying Z plus category security cover. Officially 900 people were killed in Mumbai 1992-93 communal riots, 575 of them were Muslims, 275 Hindus and 50 othersΒ (Nayar, 2015). Bal Thackeray was indicted by Justice Srikrishna Commission (Justice Srikrishna, 1998). Empathy with persons in conflict with law There are three reasons for empathy with persons in conflict with law (pcwl). One β€“ of course, family members, even if disapproving the activity of the person could have empathy or at least a humanitarian duty of participating in the last rites of the person. Two β€“ when people value contribution of the pcwl to their lives and their deeds perceived as heroic. Three β€“ empathizers share the socio-economic background with the pcwl, particularly, those from the marginalized and oppressed sections like the oppressed and marginalised castes, ethnic groups or minority communities. They understand why the pcwl had to adopt means that were in conflict with law when they themselves experience powerlessness, subjugation, exploitation and marginalization within the legal framework. The pcwl to some extent limits and resists the power of their oppressors. People attending Phoolan Deviβ€™s funeral empathized with her for this reason. The pcwl also share some of her/his booty with the needy among his/her marginalized community and in turn enjoys their support. Arun Gawli, from an OBC caste, was popular among the residents of Dagdi Chawl, Vardarajan was popular in Dharavi among the otherwise marginalized Tamil community largely drawn from SC and OBC castes. The pcwls from marginalised sections are more like Robinhoods. They do not affect the structures of oppression, exploitation and marginalization. They ensure only a sense of honour and dignity and semblance of counter power and minor economic gains β€“ e.g. marginal increase in wages or end to unpaid work for feudal oppressors, or employment in the pcwlβ€™s occupation. The pcwls from the marginalized community cannot sustain themselves for long without finding for themselves safe havens in forests or ultimately end up working for the interest of dominant elite. The smugglers end up benefiting the industrialist and builders benefit from the land mafia. Muslim youth Continuous exclusion, discrimination, lack of educational and livelihood opportunities, communal violence and marginalization, did lead to some Muslim youth too to be in conflict with law. Attack on sacred symbols and beliefs (claim to 3,000 mosques where temples existed) and subjugating them to brutal display of force and violence shakes their sense of self and community; shakes the foundation of their human existence. A survivor in Muzaffarnagar started crying like a child seeing their mosque burnt down and told this writer he would never be able to return to the village where the mosque was burnt, it just did not make any sense, nor there would be any dignity left in doing so. In Atali village, Ballabhgarh, Haryana, the community was not allowed to put a roof over the place where they were praying for over 50 years! These are just not isolated examples. There have been numerous cases all over the country. Stigmatized for conducting β€love jihadβ€, being terrorists, for the dress they wear, food they eat etc. and numerous leaders of Hindu nationalist organisations reminding Muslims that Gujarat and Muzaffarnagar can occur again. There is no hope of justice to the survivors of communal violence which has consumed 40,000 lives in independent India, including Mumbai, Bhiwandi, Ahmedabad, Meerut, Aligarh, Moradabad, Godhara, Sitamarhi, Bhagalpur, Nellie, and numerous other places. When a human rights activist like Teesta Setalvad struggles for justice to survivors of 2002 riots in Gujarat, the entire state tries to put her behind bars and calls her enemy of the state. The community had its Haji Mastan, Karim Lala, Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon and others. There is no gainsaying that all the Muslim youth accused by the security forces of terrorist activities are innocent. Conversely all of them are not guilty just because security forces have accused them to be terrorists. A large number of innocent youth are arrested accused of terror for ulterior motives and suffer incarceration for years together without bail as they are charged under draconian laws without any legal justification only to be discharged by courts as innocents. They return losing their prime years to a world of stigma and unemployment, sometimes forced out of professional courses they were pursuing at the time of their arrest. When the community loses hopes for justice, a few youth take upon themselves to dispense justice outside the legal framework. Their conflict with law is without any disapproval of the community. A section of the community even empathizes with them. The survivors of communal violence did not get justice even when β€secularβ€ parties claiming to oppose communal politics like the Congress, RJD, SP and numerous others were at the helm. On the other hand, Hindu nationalist organizations and leaders of the BJP are aggressively communalizing the public discourse. The Muslim community, in spite of its sectoral, caste and biradari based, linguistic, cultural, jurisprudential and other diversities, divisions and political conflicts, feel under siege and there is an urge to unite politically and have a strong leader who would deliver justice β€“ social, political and economic. Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM is trying to benefit from the situation and emerge as a β€strong leaderβ€™ of the community and its sole spokesperson by cleverly choosing his discourse that sounds to be within the Constitutional framework and yet exploiting the victimhood feeling within the community. He targets and opposes every party that vie for support of the Muslim community. His political ambitions are to expand his party from Hyderabad based to an all India party and to mobilize all Muslim votes displacing the existing Muslim interest parties as well as other secular parties. Uniting the community under a Muslim interest party would serve the purpose of the Hindu nationalist organizations on one hand and the Muslim political elite belonging to ashraf biradaries (upper caste) on the other hand. Mobilization of Muslims on communal agenda pushes the Constitutional agenda of equality and social justice β€“ empowerment of socially and educationally backward classes to the margins and makes it irrelevant. Large turnout Large turnout for Yakub Memon should be seen in this light. It would be a travesty of truth to read the turnout as support for the March 12, 1993 bombings in which 257 innocent people died or any insensitivity to the survivors of the bombings. There should not be any doubt that all those who were part of Yakub Memonβ€™s funeral wanted all the guilty of the March 12 1993 bombings to be punished, including Yakub Memon. They believed that death penalty was excessive for the offence he committed and that there were extenuating circumstances. There were many non-Muslims too who believed that Yakub did not deserve death penalty for his crime. The media carried two versions. Those against capital punishment were presenting their β€evidenceβ€ and arguments that Yakub Memon surrendered himself and disclosed to the investigation agencies all material particulars about the conspiracy. He therefore deserved lenient punishment. Whereas those supporting the capital punishment to Yakub Memon would argue that someone should be held accountable for the killing 257 innocent persons in the March 12 bombings in Mumbai and handed deterrent punishment; and that Yakub Memon being one of the conspirers deserved the punishment. When a significantly large number of Indians, irrespective of their religion and community held the opinion that Yakub should not have been hanged, why single out Muslims on the basis of their religion for holding such an opinion? If the idea of India has to survive and the Constitutional vision has to survive, all Indians will have to come together build robust institutions for dispensing justice that is community, caste, nationality, ethnicity, gender and linguistic neutral; build institutions that privilege the socially and educationally backward irrespective of religion, gender, caste, ethnicity, but is not blind if injustices, exclusion, oppression and marginalization is being targeted against particular gender, caste, community, ethnicity, religion and nationality. We need to build accountable and responsible governance and participatory democracy. It is a just society that reduces crime. Victimization only produces β€heroesβ€ and a cycle of violence and counter violence no matter what deterrent punishment is handed out.
The Gujarat High Court has ordered Teesta Setalvad, Javed Anand and other accused to produce themselves every 15 days before the police. A complaint had been filed by one of the residents of Gulberg society, Firoz Khan Pathan, alleging that the money raised to construct a museum in memory of those killed during the 2002 communal violence were misused by Teesta and her husband. A single judge bench of Justice A J Desai directed Teesta Setalvad, her husband Anand and others to appear before the investigation officer every 15 days for interrogation. Senior counsel Mahesh Jethamalani appeared on behalf of crime branch and argued the matter. Mihir Thakore, counsel of Teesta Setalvad, sought time from the Court on which Jethamalni objected and presented that accused were not co-operating with the investigation. He requested the court to direct all the accused to appear before the investigating officer to which the Judge agreed. Setalvad, her husband Anand and three others were earlier booked by the detection of crime branch (DCB) in the alleged case of embezzlement of funds meant for converting Gulberg society into a 'Museum of Resistance'. As many as 69 persons were allegedly burnt to death in Gulberg society during the aftermath of Godhra train burning incident in 2002. A local court had recently rejected pleas filed by activist Teesta,Javed Anand and their two NGOs seeking to de-freeze their bank accounts attached earlier by police in connection with an alleged embezzlement case.

Ahmedabad:Β The city police, probing the alleged Gulberg Society fund misuse case, today opposed the pleas filed by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gujarat High Court to de-freeze their and their two NGOsβ€™ bank accounts. Investigating officer of Gulberg Society fund misuse case, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) K N Patel, filed an affidavit in the high court, reiterating their claims that Setalvad and Anand had misused the money, meant for the 2002 Gujarat riots victims, for their personal use. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and their two NGOs Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace had been frozen by the city crime branch last year. The action came soon after it began investigating the case, in which Setalvad allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society into a 2002 riots museum but later utilised that money for personal use. In an affidavit submitted before Justice Sonia Gokani of the high court, Patel said that Setalvad and Anand spent the riot-victimsβ€™ funds for their personal and luxury uses. Opposing the coupleβ€™s pleas, the state agency said both of them, as trustees of the two NGos, through diverse methods allegedly misappropriated the funds. β€They have misused the funds meant for the rehabilitation and welfare of the unfortunate victims of riots in Gujarat and money collected for construction of the dream museum,β€ stated the affidavit filed by Patel. The agency said that the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulberg society, which was devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of very personal nature have been debited by them. The high court is likely to conduct hearing on the case on August 19. Setalvad, along with others, had filed the plea before the Gujarat High Court on June 24 to de-freeze their bank accounts. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court which had in November last year rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts observing it may affect the investigation into the case. The lower court had in its order also observed that the accused persons did not cooperate with the investigation into the case. One of the residents of Gulberg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan, had filed a complaint against Setalvad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulberg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but not been utilised for the purpose. On January 5 last year, an FIR was lodged under IPC section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, section 406 (fraud) and section 420 (cheating) against Setalvad, Anand and others for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore in the name of building a museum at Gulberg Society massacre site here. Setalvad has also filed an anticipatory bail plea in the Supreme Court, which is pending at present.
Ahmedabad Β : Opposing the plea of de-freezing the bank accounts of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in Gujarat High Court, on Wednesday, Ahmedabad Crime Branch reiterated its earlier statement that Setalvad had misappropriated funds for social work. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and their two NGOs Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace had been frozen by the city crime branch last year. The action came soon after it began investigating the case, in which Setalvad allegedly collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulberg Society into a 2002 riots museum but later utilised that money for personal use.

In yet another blow to activist Teesta Setalvad, who took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Gujarat chief minister during the 2002 riots, the ministry of home affairs has suspended the FCRA registration of her NGO Sabrang Trust. It has also served a notice to the NGO under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 asking it to explain within 30 days why its registration should not be cancelled. If the ministry is not convinced with Sabrangβ€™s reply, it will cancel the FCRA registration of the NGO cutting its supply of foreign funds completely. However, Sabrang has been charged with diverting foreign contributions from Ford Foundation to non-FCRA registered entities and also violating other FCRA provisions. In its four page order suspending the NGOs FCRA registration, the ministry has said that on inspection of the accounts it was learnt that both Teesta and her husband, who are chief functionaries and trustees of Sabrang Trust were also working for the magazine Communlaism Combat, which comes in violation of the provisions of the foreign contribution law. Sabrang Trust is also charged with using foreign donations to the tune of $2,50,000 received from the Ford Foundation for purposes other than for what the grant was received. It alleges Teesta and her husband had been using NGO funds for their personal expenses. The report also notes that Setalvadβ€™s organisations β€”Sabrang Trust, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL) were using the same office, furniture and resources but showing them as separate entities in their accounts. The investigation into Sabrang Trustβ€™s records accounts shows that Setalvad and her husband had spent over 64 per cent of the total donation worth Rs 48.42 lakhs received in 2010-11 and 55 per cent of Rs 49 lakhs received in 2011-12 on administrative expenses, which is in excess of the 50 per cent limit set as per the FCRA Β  Tweet

In an affidavit before a sessions court earlier and in arguments opposing the anticipatory bail application, the CBI said Ms. Setalvad was a threat to national security. β€Stoking tensionsβ€ Additional Solicitor-General Anil Singh, appearing for the CBI, cited a letter of the Gujarat government, which said that the SCPPL was a β€proxy organisationβ€ cultivated by the Foundation with β€some long-term plan.β€ He also contended that the Foundation was β€stoking religious tensionsβ€ and keeping the β€2002 riot incidents alive.β€ However, rejecting this contention, Justice Bhatkar held, β€After going through the papers and the submissions, prima facie I am unable to find out any threat to sovereignty, integrity and security of the State or to the strategic, economic or public interest. The submission that it [offence] is harmful to the State cannot be appreciated at this stage.β€ Though the court prima facie found violation of law in the case against Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand, it granted them anticipatory bail on the grounds that their custodial interrogation was not necessary as the case was based on documentary evidence of accounts and they were not likely to flee from justice. If arrested, the duo can be released on a surety of Rs. 20,000 each. They have to take the courtβ€™s permission to travel abroad and have to intimate the CBI if they leave Mumbai.
The National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) has withdrawn its demand of sovereignty and now want β€a solution within the Constitution of Indiaβ€, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju said on Saturday, days after the Naga β€peace accordβ€ was signed at a much-publicised ceremony here. The accord became possible because Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a β€big leadβ€, Mr. Rijiju said, even as he acknowledged that the northeastern states of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh were not consulted as the β€final solution has not been arrived yetβ€. In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, the Minister, who is from Arunachal Pradesh, said the deal was only a β€framework agreementβ€. Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, he said, have been forced to make a U-turn and oppose it on the directions of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi. At a high-profile event on August 3, presided over by Mr. Modi, the government announced that a β€peace accordβ€ had been signed with the NSCN(I-M), the largest Naga group in talks with the government. If the Chief Ministers Tarun Gogoi, Nabam Tuki and Okram Ibobi Singh, whose States have a sizeable Naga population, said they were not consulted on the Naga peace accord, even the Home Affairs Ministry was reportedly kept out of the entire process.  Asked if the Ministry was consulted before the announcement, Mr. Rijiju said: β€The interlocutor [peace interlocutor R.N. Ravi] represents the government. He briefs the Home Ministry from time to time. It does not make any difference, how and when it was decided. That was the PMβ€™s call; it does not mean we were in the dark. PM wants action and proper positive action, without any delay. It is just an announcement, not important when I came to know. We are all part of the team.β€ He said nobody in the northeast opposed the agreement. β€It is only because of Ms. Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi that it is being made into a political issue. Why should Congress parade its Chief Ministers against such an important decision? PM has said they would be consulted in due course of time. They can make their point later on. Asking them [the Chief Ministers] to delete Facebook and Twitter posts [praising the deal] and oppose this particular step was [a] totally avoidable [act of the Congress]. I did not expect a national party like the Congress to play politics,β€ Mr. Rijiju said.  Myanmar operation Referring to the episode in which Special Forces of the Indian Army crossed into Myanmar and destroyed insurgent camps including that of the NSCN-Khaplang, a group that violated the ceasefire with India in March, Mr. Rijiju said the 1,643-km-long border the two countries shared was not manned properly as India and Myanmar had friendly relations. Explaining that India would require an agreement to fence the border, he said: β€Currently, we donβ€™t deploy border guards at zero point. Right now, there is no such move to fence it either. We have to make our border patrolling more robust. The militant groups operate on this side as well as that side of the border. The issue concerns both the countries.β€ The Home Ministry has moved a Cabinet note to compensate families whose members have been killed in firing along the Pakistan border. β€We have moved the Cabinet [to put on par] those killed due to ceasefire violation by Pakistani forcesβ€ with victims of communal violence or terrorist acts. The suggestion to give Rs. 5 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased is at a proposal stage now. Action against Teesta Defending the Home Ministryβ€™s action in recommending a CBI investigation against an association run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, Mr. Rijiju said: β€These are not new cases: the Gujarat government is also probing cases against NGOs run by Teesta Setalvad.β€ The Ministry, he said, is not targeting a particular NGO. It has to act as there is clear evidence of violation of norms. β€We just want to make the system robust. The inaction of the previous government cannot prevent us from taking action. It was not that the Gujarat government was against Teesta β€¦ She was throughout trying to malign the Gujarat government,β€ he said. He said the Ford Foundation, which financed Ms. Setalvadβ€™s NGOs, would continue to be under the scanner and under the β€prior-permissionβ€ category. The Ministry recently unblocked foreign funds totalling $150,000 to be released to the U.S. donorβ€™s bank accounts.
"Condemn the murder of Kannada rationalist M.M. Kalburgi.Seeing a shrinking space for free expression, academics and activists on Saturday turned their ire on the corporate sector and Non Resident Indians (NRIs) for \orchestrating\"" the BJPβ€™s electoral victory in the Lok Sabha elections last year. Agitated by the series of attacks on freedom of expression- the latest being the murder of Kannada rationalist M. M. Kalburgi, lawyer Anil Nauriya said at a press conference, β€I donβ€™t expect answers from the Bajrang Dal, VHP, RSS or even the BJP. I hold the captains of industry and NRIs accountable for distorting the outcome of the elections knowing fully well the dangers involved in having such a party in power.β€™β€™ He was addressing a press conference organised by the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust to protest the β€assault on reasonβ€ that has manifested itself not just in the killing of Kalburgi or Govind Pansare in February but also in the effort to replace history with mythology. Historian Irfan Habib and economist Prabhat Patnaik joined Mr. Nauriya in blaming corporates for helping in the ``Fascisifictaionβ€™β€™ of India while activist Teesta Setalvad underlined the fact that the founding fathers had rejected religion-based nationhood for India. β€The captains of industry have created this situation for their narrow gains. Through the Nehruvian era, they complained against restrictions. Post-liberalisation also, they kept complaining. No matter how open the economy is, it is never enough for them. While they want a liberal economy, they do not want a liberal landscape. They need to be held accountable for joining hands with forces that have taken the country back by a century,β€™β€™ Mr. Nauriya said. He was equally critical of NRIs and their desire to interfere in Indian politics which goes back to the 1980s when they began to demand voting rights. According to him, the founding fathers had made residence in India a pre-requisite for having the right to vote so that it is exercised with caution; fully conscious of the consequences. Prof. Habib and Prof. Patnaik were one in likening the situation evolving in India to the eve of Hitlerβ€™s rise. β€We must realize that we are now governed by the RSS which from its inception never concealed its fascination for Fascism. The Second RSS Sarsanghachalak M. S. Golwalkar had praised Hitler and his treatment of the Jews,β€™β€™ the historian said. Just like Nazi Germany, the current dispensation wants to replace history with mythology, is inventing facts, and has the support of the moneybags. β€In 1933, German business supported Hitler and in 1945 they said they had made a mistake,β€™β€™ Prof. Habib said. Echoing him, Prof. Patnaik added that the Government was adding to the crisis by systematically destroying the intellectual resources β€“ particularly, the study of arts and humanities -- needed for a struggle against Fascism. ``Killing all scope for rational discourse is part of the plot.β€™β€™"""
Rajiv Mehrishi replaces LC Goyal at North Block In a sudden and surprise move, the Narendra Modi government on Monday gave marching orders to L.C. Goyal as Union home secretary, and named senior IAS officer Rajiv Mehrishi for the top job at MHA. A 1979-batch IAS officer, Mr Goyal had barely completed six months in the high-profile post, which has a two-year fixed tenure. The new home secretary, Mr Mehrishi, the handpicked choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was serving as secretary in the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry and was due to retire on Monday. He took charge as home secretary on Monday itself, hours after Mr Goyal resigned. With Mr Mehrishiβ€™s appointment, the home ministry under Rajnath Singh has got a third home secretary in less than two years of the NDA government coming to power at the Centre. An order issued by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, said: β€Mr Goyalβ€™s request for voluntary retirement from service has been accepted with immediate effect by waiving off the notice period.β€ It further said Mr Mehrishi has been appointed home secretary for a period of two years from the date of taking charge from the incumbent. Mr Goyalβ€™s departure comes amid reports of serious differences with home minister Rajnath Singh over his β€style of functioningβ€, while he had repeated run-ins with the finance ministry and the national security adviser, the latest being over the Naga accord. Mr Goyal, however, refused to attribute reasons for his sudden resignation, saying he didnβ€™t want to continue for β€personal reasonsβ€. Late on Monday evening, Mr Goyal was appointed as the chairman of the relatively low-profile Indian Trade Promotion Organisation. β€It was my own decision,β€ Mr Goyal said, adding that any other reason mentioned was β€factually incorrectβ€. This is the third instance of a top bureaucrat being shifted out in the past one year β€” after Sujatha Singh was sacked as foreign secretary in January and Anil Goswami removed as home secretary last year for allegedly interfering in a CBI probe on behalf of a Congress leader. Among officers, then SPG boss Durga Prasad was also removed overnight by the NDA government last year. Top sources said Mr Goyalβ€™s fate was sealed on Friday after home minister Rajnath Singh spoke to the PM and called Mr Goyal to his residence on Saturday to say that his contiuance in the ministry had become β€untenableβ€. Sources said the home minister was β€unhappyβ€ with Mr Goyalβ€™s style of functioning, where his authority was challenged and decisions were not implemented to his satisfaction. β€The home minister wanted the wheels of bureaucracy to function fast and smooth, keeping pace with his governmentβ€™s quick announcements, which are result-oriented,β€ a top official said. From reallocating work among MHA officers despite the home ministerβ€™s decree against it to non-implementation of decisions taken at the highest level like removing Iran from the list of countries under β€prior reference categoryβ€, Mr Goyal had repeated run-ins with the finance ministry, that led to matters getting stuck, sources said. The run-ins with the finance ministry included issues of denial of security clearance to Sun TV owned by the Maran group, fund allocation cuts by the finance ministry to Central schemes like police modernisation and infrastructure for Naxalite-affected areas, besides some issues related to an NGO headed by activist Teesta Setalvad. Mr Goyalβ€™s ouster also comes at a time when Mr Modi is learnt to have expressed his displeasure over the handling of the Patel quota agitation by the government. The PM had expressed displeasure over it and is learnt to have called it an β€intelligence failureβ€, amid some indications that β€heads may rollβ€ over the issue. Home ministry sources said Mr Goyal was still on his way to MHA on Monday morning to wind up charge as the official notification came announcing his exit and giving Mr Mehrishiβ€™s continuance in the government a new lease of life. While Mr Goyal did not come to office to demit charge, Mr Mehrishi took over and later met the home minister at his residence. Β  Tweet
Pavan K. Varma The truth is that the CBI has always bended with alacrity to accommodate the biases of its political masters. But these days some rather strange things are happening inside the cage. On May 10, 2013, Justice Rajendra Mal Lodha of the Supreme Court said that the Central Bureau of Investigation is a β€caged parrotβ€. To reinforce his point, the learned judge added that the CBI was also β€its masterβ€™s voiceβ€. When in Opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party hailed this damning critique. It used to call the CBI the β€Congress Bureau of Investigationβ€. Today, the Congress calls it the β€Gujarat Bureau of Investigationβ€. The truth is that the CBI has always bended with alacrity to accommodate the biases of its political masters. But these days some rather strange things are happening inside the cage. There are two appointments, in particular, which appear to be a cause of concern. Y.C. Modi, a police officer of the Assam-Meghalaya cadre, has been appointed as additional director of the CBI. And, Arun Kumar Sharma, a police officer of the Gujarat cadre, has been appointed as the joint director. Mr Y.C. Modi was part of the CBI team that investigated the Haren Pandya murder case. Since public memory is short, it will be useful to recall that Pandya was a minister in the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat. He was, reports say, about to give testimony to the courts about the involvement of the then chief minister and his senior Cabinet colleagues in the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, when he was shot dead by so-called β€extremistsβ€. Mr Y.C. Modi was one of the officers detailed to discover the truth, but the Gujarat high court was constrained to say that the entire investigation was β€botched upβ€. The investigating officers, the court said, β€Ought to be held accountable for their ineptitude resulting in injusticeβ€¦β€ Mr Y.C. Modi was also part of the Special Investigating Team under former CBI director R.K. Raghavan to investigate the Gujarat riots. The SIT gave a clean chit to Mr Narendra Modi, although Raju Ramachandran, the amicus curiae appointed by the Supreme Court, put down his strong reservations on this acquittal. Readers may also recall the infamous β€Snoopgateβ€ saga. Cobrapost and gulail.com released audiotapes of 239 conversations purportedly between then Gujarat home minister Amit Shah and his stateβ€™s police officers in which Mr Shah is allegedly complicit in monitoring the surveillance of a young woman on behalf of his β€Sahebβ€. Mr Sharma was inspector general of police (Intelligence) in Gujarat at that time, and the 39 supplementary tapes released by Cobrapost subsequently indicate that Mr Sharma β€could be heard telling his own people to conduct a parallel surveillance of the lady not just in Gujarat but in Karnatakaβ€. Mr Y.C. Modi and Mr Sharma have now been appointed as senior and key functionaries of the CBI. In fact, as additional director, Mr Y.C. Modi may well succeed current director Anil Sinha. Javeed Ahmed, the officer reportedly next in line, was transferred out of the CBI soon after the BJP came to power in May 2014. It is this kind of β€caged parrotβ€ which will now investigate the Vyapam scam. Does one still have reason to hope that this investigation will not also be, in the words of the Gujarat high court in the Haren Pandya murder case, β€botched upβ€? There are other signs of strange behaviour. In December 2014, a CBI trial court in Mumbai surprisingly decided to acquit key accused, Mr Shah, in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case without even a trial. The CBI, which had earlier produced hundreds of pages of evidence against him in this case, and had charged him also with being the β€kingpin and prime accusedβ€ in the Tulsiram Prajapati case, surprisingly refused to appeal the decision. Can an investigating agency change its stance on a matter of such importance so dramatically, and merely, as it seems, because its β€mastersβ€ have changed? Even more worrisome is what is happening to police officers earlier arrested in the Ishrat Jahan, Tulsiram Prajapati and Sohrabuddin fake encounter cases. P.P. Pandey was arrested in August 2013, for allegedly conspiring to carry out the encounter of Ishrat Jahan in 2004. But in February 2015, a special court of the CBI granted him bail. Shockingly, within days of the bail, the Gujarat government revoked his suspension and reinstated him as additional director-general of police in charge of law and order! There is also the case of Indian Police Service officer Vipul Agarwal. Mr Agarwal was arrested in May 2010, for complicity in the alleged fake encounter of Tulsiram Prajapati, who was the prime witness in the fake encounter case of Sohrabuddin and his wife. In November 2015, a month after Mr Agarwal was granted bail by the Mumbai high court, the Gujarat government reinstated him in the office of director-general of police. Bail is not an exoneration of guilt. How can officers not yet acquitted in such serious crimes be reinstated when still on bail? On the other hand, the β€caged parrotβ€ bears its claws and uses its curved beak ferociously against those who have the temerity to question the actions of the Gujarat government. The case of Teesta Setalvad, the well-known civil activist who helped in ensuring life imprisonment to 20 of the accused in the Gujarat riots, is illustrative. She, and her husband Javed Anand, are literally being hounded as though they are heinous criminals, even though she has submitted over 5,000 pages of documents rebutting each charge. Fortunately, the Mumbai high court has upheld the validity of dissent in a democratic country. Three questions arise: firstly, while the CBI director is appointed by a troika consisting of Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India (or a Supreme Court judge nominated by him) and the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, what checks are there to ensure that key officers under him are untainted and objective? Secondly, can the CBI suddenly take a U-turn on the issue of prosecution of somebody it has for long considered guilty, and not even appeal an acquittal by a trial court? Thirdly, can police officers out on bail for serious offences be reinstated without final exoneration? Setting the β€caged parrotβ€ free is one of the key unfinished businesses of Indiaβ€™s experience as a democracy, and the only court of hope in achieving this is the Supreme Court. The nation, and the people of India, will be eternally grateful if it takes suo motu initiative in this regard. Author-diplomat Pavan K. Varma is a Rajya Sabha member Β  Tweet
Activities of more than 15 NGOs in the country are now under the scanner of the CBI for the alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The agency, which recently registered a case against civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad, is now scrutinising banks account details of these NGOs. More cases are expected to be registered very soon. Sources said, β€Adverse reports were received against some NGOs and after inspections and scrutiny of accounts, 15 cases have been referred to CBI and 10 to the state police. Accounts of 23 NGOs have been frozenβ€. The CBI will soon initiate action against 15 NGOs, they added. The agency will soon seek all documents pertaining to foreign funds received by these NGOs. Earlier, the CBI on July 8 registered a case against Ms Setalvad and her NGO for alleged violation of the FCRA. The agency named Ms Setalvadβ€™s husband Javed Anand and Gulam Mohammed Peshimam, both directors in Sabrang Communications and Publishing based in Mumbai, in its FIR. It may be recalled that the MHA had ordered a CBI probe into Ms Setalvadβ€™s NGO for accepting and diverting funds from the Ford Foundation allegedly in violation of rules. Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited allegedly accepted a donation of $2.9 lakh from Ford Foundation without getting clearance from the home ministry, sources said. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it is registered under the FCRA. Recently, the Centre cancelled registration of 4470 NGOs under the provisions of the FCRA after examination of their activities that allegedly included non-filing of annual returns and other anomalies. All associations were given proper notice by the foreigners division of the home ministry with adequate time to reply before their FCRA licences were cancelled, sources said. Earlier, licences of nearly 9,000 NGOs were cancelled in April for alleged violation of FCRA. Β  Tweet
Paranjoy Guha Thakurta One of the most distinctive features of the functioning of the Narendra Modi government over the last 15 months has been its attempt to control the flows of information and marginalise dissent. The Prime Ministerβ€™s preference for one-way communication is well known. However, attempts by supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, to curb free expression by intimidating those who do not think like them are backfiring and, in fact, strengthening their political opponents. A simple truth about the noisy democracy that is India seems to be escaping many of those in power at present. The more you try and stifle the expression of views that run contrary to yours, the greater are the chances that you will convert your critics into martyrs and attract greater sympathy for them. One obvious example is that of Teesta Setalvad, who has done more than many others for the Muslim victims of the 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat. In the process, the government has also sought to make life a little difficult for Ford Foundation β€” not because this organisation has funded some of Indiaβ€™s better known educational institutions, but because it has supported one body with which Ms Setalvad is associated. Let us acknowledge for a moment that there may have been no vindictiveness on the part of particular government functionaries to clamp down on certain non-government organisations for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Let us believe that these people in government sincerely believe that these organisations are working against the economic interests of the country by opposing nuclear power and coal mining projects. Let us also accept that such so-called troublemakers receiving foreign funds are to be discouraged, unlike those who bring in foreign direct investment (FDI) that creates jobs for our youth. To be fair to the BJP, there are many in the Congress as well as in other parties who share similar views about NGOs. But the issue of stifling dissenting views goes much deeper. One has to merely look at the manner in which the ministry of information and broadcasting has dealt with the striking students of the Film and Television Institute of India to appreciate the fact that this government does not really believe in artistic freedom. The fact that past regimes have packed educational institutions with their loyalists becomes a good enough reason to act in an identical manner, even if the political appointee in this instance, Gajendra Chauhan, can be politely described as a mediocrity. The same vituperative language is deployed to describe all those who refuse to toe the line β€” they are anti-Hindu and, worse, anti-national. It would be instructive to try and understand why the government backtracked after failing to amend the land acquisition law. This was not only on account of the fact that some of the BJPβ€™s partners in the National Democratic Alliance coalition as well as sections within the Sangh Parivar were not convinced by the claim that the law needed amendment to improve the ease of doing business in the country. Mr Modi has projected himself as a no-nonsense, go-getting Prime Minister unlike his weak and vacillating predecessor Manmohan Singh. Under the circumstances, he thought he must not be perceived as a man who buckles under pressure. But he had to do precisely that after seven months of dilly-dallying and failed attempts to find a solution to a self-created problem. The decision, reported in this publication on August 23, not to re-promulgate the ordinance to change the land acquisition law, came after the Prime Minister expended and wasted a considerable amount of political capital. Here was a classic case of excessive self-confidence or hubris leading to acts of utter stupidity. Mr Modi surely knew that the BJP would not be able to command the support of a majority of MPs in the Rajya Sabha in a hurry. Still, he was obdurate in order to preserve his image of being a decisive leader. The loss of face in this instance was clearly avoidable. Mr Modi may believe that the government-owned Prasar Bharati, which runs Doordarshan and All India Radio, must toe the party line and not broadcast anything that is even mildly critical of those in government. In this respect, he is acting in a manner which is not very different from the way Indira Gandhi acted during the Emergency. But he wonβ€™t be successful simply because much has changed over the last four decades, including the proliferation of opinion on the social media that the present Prime Minister loves so much. There is a problem when half-truths are peddled as the reality on the ground. You start believing in them and then β€” like Indira Gandhi who was surrounded by sycophants, especially between June 1975 and March 1977 β€” grow distant from the people you claim to represent. This is the real and present danger that Mr Modi faces. He should check the number of people who have voluntarily given up their subsidised connections of cooking gas. He should also ascertain whether or not his governmentβ€™s statistics are accurate before highlighting the number of new bank accounts opened under the Jan Dhan Yojana over the past 12 months because nearly half of these accounts have zero balance in them. He also needs to find out if many of the toilets that have been constructed as part of the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan are non-functional. One can go on repeating what has been said over and over again, namely that Mr Modi cannot govern India in the way he governed Gujarat. But he has shown little signs so far of changing the way he operates. The big question that is being asked now is whether a large section of voters in Bihar believe in the promises he has made about infusing humongous amounts of money in the economically backward state β€” the equivalent of providing more than `1,00,000 to each citizen of the country! Mr Modi should remember Abraham Lincolnβ€™s much-quoted adage: β€You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.β€ The writer is an educator and commentator Β  Tweet
The stars indicate that the activistβ€™s legal problems will continue for sometime to come Teesta Setalvad, well- known civil rights activist and journalist, who heads the NGO β€” Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), has been embroiled in legal trouble for a very long time now. As the secretary and chief functionary of CJP, she has been vigorously fighting cases stemming from the 2002 Godhra riots. In turn, she too has six cases filed against her by the Gujarat government. And recently a fresh FIR was filed against her by the CBI. Now, as she prepares to continue her fight in the Zakia Jafri case, she is yet again in the limelight. Will stars relent and make her life smoother? What has made her road so full of hurdles? Letβ€™s take a look at her solar horoscope to answer these and other questions. The Planetary Picture In Teestaβ€™s Solar Chart, majority of the planets are placed in Capricorn. This is a clear indication of her natural patience and perseverance. This planetary strength seems to have helped her fight for so many years, while making her way through the maze of the complex Indian judicial system. Further, Mars in close conjunction with Saturn in her Solar Chart indicates her strong, aggressive character and mental and physical endurance (to fight for a cause). However, given the severe afflictions of the benefic planets in her chart, her life has turned out to be a series of constant struggles. Adding to this is the fact that all the planets in her solar chart are hemmed in between the malefic Rahu and Ketu. This planetary factor has led to the constant shadow of doubt, conspiracy and treachery in her life. Rahuβ€™s hidden, illusive nature and Ketuβ€™s secretive conquests have pockmarked this strong ladyβ€™s life path with all sorts of confusions, illusions and confusions. The Future Currently, the transiting (retrograde) Saturn is aspecting the natal Sun and Saturn in Teesta's chart. Plus, the transiting Ketu is moving over her natal Moon. Moon is the signifier of emotions and mind, and the passing over of the detached and hazy Ketu over this has led to Teesta facing so much of pressure, turmoil and legal hazards. Saturnβ€™s movement is also not favourable for her. As Saturn deals with dark issues, grey areas and areas of law and enforcement, its retrograde motion (to continue till early August) has cast a major shadow on Teestaβ€™s case. In the coming times too, the transiting Saturn in Scorpio (till 2017) may remain stressful for her, and she might undergo a very lengthy legal battle. As of now, Venus is moving in a retrograde motion, and is in Leo. This is not a great placement for Setalvad and her NGO. There is a possibility of cancellation of the registration of her NGO, particularly till September 5, 2015. Conclusion All in all, Teesta Setalvad will be able to find legal remedies and ways to tackle the pressure situations, given the natal strength.However, the transiting Rahu in Leo, from January 2016 onwards, may again bring a new set of problems for her. So the planetary positions in the next one-and-half year may not allow her to settle down Β  Tweet
The CBI on Wednesday registered a case against social activist Teesta Setalvad and her organisation for alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). According to sources, the CBI has also named Ms Setalvadβ€™s husband Javed Anand and Gulam Mohammed Peshimam, both directors in Sabrang Communications and Publishing based in Mumbai, in its FIR. The case has been registered under the IPC section related to criminal conspiracy (120-B), along with provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976, sources said. The agency, sources said, will soon call Ms Setalvad and her husband for examination. The agency sleuths will also seek all documents pertaining to foreign funds received by the NGO from her, they added. The case has been registered following the request of the Union home ministry. It may be recalled that the MHA had recently ordered a CBI probe into Ms Setalvadβ€™s NGO for accepting and diverting funds from Ford Foundation allegedly in violation of rules and also froze a bank account of the firm. Sources said Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited had allegedly, in violation of rules of FCRA, accepted a donation of $290,000 from Ford Foundation without getting clearance from the home ministry. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it is registered under FCRA. Recently, the Centre cancelled the registration of 4470 NGOs under the provisions of the FCRA after examination of their activities that allegedly included non-filing of annual returns and other anomalies.

Ahmedabad: Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs - Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch last year, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society to 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case. One of the residents of Gulbarg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan had filed a complaint against Setalwad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulbarg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but it had not been utilised for the purpose. On January 5 last year, an FIR was lodged under IPC Section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, Section 406 (fraud) and Section 420 (cheating) against Setalwad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, chairman of Gulberg society Salim Sandhi and secretary of the society Feroz Gulzar for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore. Yesterday, the Centre had asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by her private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. Government had also frozen the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). On 28 February, 2002, after the Godhra train carnage, 69 people including Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society here during the riots. Β  Tweet
The government is mulling asking the CBI to step in to probe the alleged acceptance of funds from the Ford Foundation by the activist β€™s Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL). This donation is being viewed by the home ministry as a serious violation of FCRA provisions, which mandates funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration. Official sources said SCPPL had accepted a grant of $2.9 lakh from the Ford Foundation despite being a private firm not having FCRA clearance from the ministry of home affairs under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). The sources claimed the home ministry during its inspection of the companyβ€™s accounts found that an amount of `50 lakh was allegedly transferred to it by Setalvadβ€™s Sabrang Trust which also was in violation of FCRA norms. The Gujarat government had asked the home ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was β€interfering in internal affairsβ€ of the country and also β€abetting communal disharmonyβ€ through an NGO run by social activist . The fund transfer from Ford Foundation, at present, has to be cleared by a nodal official in the home ministry. In April, the government had ordered that funds from the Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the home ministry. Β  Tweet
New Delhi: Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notices by the Union Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and asked to reply within 15 days. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Ms. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notice two days ago following an on-site inspection of records and books of accounts carried out by the Ministry officials in April 2015. During the probe, sources said, it was found that they were running a magazine Communalism Combat as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under the FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. The CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs. 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs. 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for β€educational and economicβ€ purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as β€legal aidβ€, which is covered under purpose β€socialβ€. Hence, it violated the provisions of the FCRA rules, the sources contended. β€On review of vouchers of the association it was found that Sabrang Trust have made payment of Rs. 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand. β€This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,β€ the Home Ministry notice said. The Home Ministry investigation also found that Mr. Anand has taken international medical policy for visiting Lahore and debited the amount in the account of Sabrang Trust. Further, even book purchases and travel expenses incurred by him to attend meetings with the Peopleβ€™s Union For Civil Liberties were debited in Sabrang Trust allegedly in violation of Section 8(1)(a) of FCRA. The Home Ministryβ€™s inspection has also found that an amount of Rs. 50 lakh was allegedly transferred by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL which is not registered under FCRA. FCRA rules prohibit transfer of foreign contribution to any non-FCRA account unless such entity is also registered and had been granted the certificate or obtained prior permission under this Act. The investigation also found various alleged irregularities like administrative expenditure exceeding more than 50 per cent. Besides, different figures towards expenses incurred on legal aid in the books of accounts and in the receipts of payment accounts, closing balance of the proceeding year was allegedly not reported as opening balance and even the funds received from United Nations not found in the bank statement, the sources claimed.

The Narendra Modi government has reconstituted the Central Advisory Board of Education, the countryβ€™s top advisory body on education, with several new members with strong Sangh affiliations. Among those nominated are Swami Atmapriyananda, VC, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University, Belur Math, and Anirban Ganguly, director of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation. Actress Swaroop Sampat, wife of BJP MP Paresh Rawal, was chosen as a representative of the creative arts. Other nominees include Prof. Syed A. Bari, VC, Central University of Gujarat. The HRD ministry reconstituted CABE as it wanted to replace members regarded as close to the UPA. As earlier reported by this newspaper, UPA nominees like activist Teesta Setalvad and Sanskrit scholar Satyavrat Shastri are not a part of the reconstituted CABE. The first meeting of the reconstituted body is expected to take place soon. The government is expected to propose the reversal of several UPA-initiated education reforms, sources said. In a major policy shift, a review of the no-detention policy till Class 8 and reintroduction of mandatory Class 10 board exams in CBSE schools is expected to come up at the meeting. Β  Tweet
"With the 1983 Nellie massacre, India entered a new chapter of mass communal violence: of large-scale slaughters of religious minorities with gravely culpable state support. Nellie was followed by the anti-Sikh pogrom in Delhi in 1984, the murder by men in khaki of around 40 Muslim men in Hashimpura in 1987, the Bhagalpur carnage of 1989, the communal slaughter on Bombayβ€™s streets in 1992-'93, climaxing in the brutal massacre across cities and villages in Gujarat in 2002. Each of these blood-drenched massacres was characterised by impunity. A disgraceful tradition unbroken until 2002, impunity is the assurance that you will not be punished if you commit crimes. This license has been assured equally to the foot soldiers of these massacres, the shadowy non-state organisations that organise these slaughters, and the public officials in command positions whose acts of culpable inaction or action enable these crimes against humanity. I will never forget how a survivor of the carnage in Gujarat explained what impunity is to me. \If you kill one person in a closed room with no witnesses,\"" he said, \""there is more chance that you will get caught and punished, than if you kill a 100 persons in the presence of a 1000 people\"". This indeed is impunity, which like a termite, unseen, annihilates democracy. Impunity is unsurpassed in the Nellie massacre of Assam, in which not one person has even faced trial, let alone been punished, for the killing in a few hours of around 3000 Bengali Muslim children, women and men. For the slaughter of nearly an equal number of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984, a handful of rioters have been convicted, but not a single political leader or police official, although their role in leading, organising and enabling the massacre is widely known. Every policeman charged with the Hashimpura massacre was acquitted after an epic 28-year battle by the working-class families of the murdered men. In Bhagalpur, again, a few marauders have been punished due to the unwavering and heroic struggles of some survivors, but most walk free, as do the guilty public officials. This dishonourable story did not change in the metropolis of Mumbai, despite the judicial commission report by Justice Srikrishna which is an outstanding example of public fairness. Wake-up call Yet one more communal massacre unfolded in Gujarat in 2002, even more pitiless and cruel in its targeting of children and women than those which preceded it, and geographically more widespread than any communal massacre after the Partition riots. This became a wake-up call for many of us, and changed the course of many lives forever. We realised that if impunity had been more resolutely and powerfully challenged and battled by human rights defenders in close solidarity with survivors of the communal massacres in Nellie, Delhi, Hashimpura, Bhagalpur and Bombay, the Gujarat carnage would not have happened. And if again we failed to effectively combat the impunity of those who planned and executed this pogrom, and of the public officials who cynically fanned the flames of communal hatred for days and weeks, then we would see even more such massacres in the days to come. And if we allowed this, then we would be complicit in losing all that is precious in the idea of India itself. Therefore many threw ourselves into the battle for justice for the survivors of the carnage in Gujarat. It became a battle for the defence of the idea of India, of secular democracy, and justice and the rule of law, and of solidarity and public compassion. There are many heroes of this extraordinary battle. Public officials like National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice JS Verma, Chief Election Commissioner JM Lyngdoh, NHRC Special Rapporteur PGP Nampoothiri, police officers like Rahul Sharma and RB Sreekumar, cultural activists like Mallika Sarabhai, human rights defenders like Mukul Sinha, Gagan Sethi, Shabnam Hashmi, and a number of young lawyers and peace and justice workers whom I worked with while fighting several hundred criminal cases with survivors in the campaign Nyayagrah. Best-known face But the best-known face of the battle against impunity in Gujarat is of feisty and courageous civil rights activist Teesta Setlawad. With her partner Javed Anand, her efforts have been central in pursuing 68 major cases of the massacre and ensuring the conviction of more than 100 persons for the first time in Indiaβ€™s troubled history of communal violence, overturning the long and shameful tradition of impunity of the perpetrators of communal carnages in free India. With the NHRC, she helped secure crucial rulings for the investigation of major massacres in the Gujarat carnage by a Special Investigation Team directly supervised by the Supreme Court; for the unprecedented trial of some of these cases by courts outside Gujarat; and for police protection of over 500 witnesses. However, what makes her even more unpopular with Indiaβ€™s current ruling formation is her audacity in backing Zakia Jafri, 76, surely one of the bravest fighters the country has today. For the Gulbarg massacre in Ahmedabad which saw the brutal killing of 69 people including her husband Ehsan Jafri, Zakia charges Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the first accused. Indiaβ€™s premier investigating agency the CBI has resorted to open official public bullying of Teesta and Javed, with innuendo, high-profile raids and searches, and its demand for her jailing for intensive custodial interrogation, for a set of minor financial charges. This is a naked official attempt at the highest level of government to break their morale and enfeeble their unrelenting battle for justice. On trial, truly, is not these two gutsy human rights defenders. On trial is Indiaβ€™s democracy. """
New Delhi, Sept 10 : The Ministry for Home Affairs is likely to suspend the registration of the Teesta Setalvad run Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act of 2010. This will block the foreign funding to the NGO. The Home Ministry has also served a notice to the NGO for cancellation of its FCRA licence. The notice which is likely to be issued today will be under Section 13 of the FCRA. The notice will detail the violations by the trust. The Sabrang Trust has been accused of using foreign funds to the tune of 2.50,000 US dollars for purposes other than it was intended to. The funds the investigations show were received from the Ford Foundation. Once the registration under FCRA is suspended then the NGO will not be entitled to get any more foreign funds. Moreover, the foreign funds that it has received till date will also be blocked. It was further alleged by the investigators that the trust used the funds to lobby with media persons in a bid to address communalism and caste based discrimination. However, the NGO was registered to carry out education related work. Earlier the Sabrang trust had told the MHA that the charges were baseless. Teesta had claimed that the probe is politically motivated and the same had been initiated because she had challenged the government in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister.

Teesta Setalvad The Ministry of Home Affairs has cleared the file revoking the FCRA registration of activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang Trust. Former Home Secretary LC Goyal had earlier objected to cancelling the FCRA clearance of Setalwad's NGO. But with Goyal being shunted out of the Home Ministry, the new incumbent Rajeev Mehrishi has given his go ahead to suspending the registration of Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 and also serving it a notice for cancellation of the NGO's FCRA licence. FCRA clearance is required by NGOs to be able to generate funds from foreign sources. The government's action will henceforth bar all foreign funding to the NGO. Sabrang has been charged with diverting foreign contributions from Ford Foundation to non-FCRA registered entities and also violating other FCRA provisions. Ministry of Home Affairs sources told India Today that the FCRA wings has been able to build a strong case against Teesta Setalwad. Sabrang Trust is charged with using foreign donations to the tune of $2,50,000 received from the Ford Foundation for purposes other than for what the grant was received. The trust is alleged to have used the Ford grant to identify and lobby with journalists to fight communalism in India. The FCRA wing of MHA claims this is unlawful because the trust is registered under FCRA as an educational and social organisation. MHA files show that Teesta and her husband had been using NGO funds for their personal expenses, in addition to drawing a fixed salary. The investigation into Sabrang Trust's records accounts shows that Setalvad and her husband had spent over 64 per cent of the total donation worth Rs 48.42 lakhs received in 2010-11 and 55 per cent of Rs 49 lakhs received in 2011-12 on administrative expenses, which is in excess of the 50 per cent limit set as per the FCRA. The government's report also notes that Setalvad's organisations - Sabrang Trust, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL) were using the same office, furniture and resources but showing them as separate entities in their accounts. Another violation mentioned in the inspection report was the payment of Setalvad and Anand's credit card bills with funds from Sabrang Trust's FCRA account. This is a violation of Section 8(1) of FCRA. Anand is also accused of diverting FCRA funds to pay for his medical policy, attending conferences and purchase of books. There has been a huge national and international outcry to the actions taken by the Modi government against Teesta Setalwad. Activists accuse the Modi govt of going on a witch hunt against the one person who fought the 2002 riot cases on behalf of the victims. The Sabrang Trust, in its response to the MHA inspection report denied all the charges levelled against it. Setalvad has earlier described the action against her NGOs as being politically motivated and a result of her challenging the Modi government in Gujarat after the 2002 riots. However, the central government denies charges of the actions being driven by personal vendetta. The government says all action has been taken in accordance with the law of the land.
New Delhi: In fresh crackdown on an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, the home ministry on Thursday suspended its registration for six months accusing the organisation of violating Foreign Currency (Regulation) Act that invites termination of its licence. In an order, the home ministry said exercising the powers conferred under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, the registration of Sabrang Trust has been suspended for a period of 180 days with effect from 10 September, 2015. The Sabrang Trust, run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, can make a representation against the order within 30 days. However, if the home ministry is not satisfied with the reply of the NGO, its registration will be cancelled. Another NGO run by Teesta and her husband, Citizens for Justice and Peace, has already been put under prior permission category, thus making it mandatory for the organisation to take permission from the home ministry before accepting or utilising any foreign contribution. Following a recommendation of the home ministry, CBI has registered a case and launched a probe against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited, a commercial firm run by Teesta, for allegedly accepting and utilising foreign contribution in violation of FCRA. Teesta has pursued the cases of post-Godhra riots victims in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of the state. Thursdayβ€™s home ministry order said that during the course of inspection of records of Sabrang Trust, it was noticed that both Teesta and Javed Anand are chief functionary or trustee of the NGO. Both are also working as directors, co-editors, printers and publisher in the company namely Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) and published a magazine called β€Communalism Combatβ€™. SCPPL had accepted contribution from foreign source, thus violating FCRA, it said. On inspection of accounts of Sabrang Trust, it was noticed that the Association has received total donation of Rs48.42 lakh and Rs49.10 lakh in 2010-11 and 2011-12 respectively out of which they have spent Rs30.97 lakh and Rs27.07 lakh which comes to 64.23% and 55.14% respectively, on administrative expenses. As per section 8 (1)(b) of FCRA 2010 requires approval of the home ministry before incurring expenses on administrative head exceeding 50% limit. Thus, it is a violation of FCRA, the ministry said.
A week after cancelling Greenpeace India's registration, the Centre on Thursday suspended the licence of Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang Trust to receive foreign donation citing 10 violations of rules.The charges include transfer of foreign funds to organisations which do not have permission to receive it and diverting foreign funds for personal use like buying an international medical insurance of Rs 1,174 for Teesta's activist-husband Javed Anand while on a visit to Pakistan and spending of Rs 4,227 for travel and books to attend a PUCL meeting.The NGO, whose licence was suspended for 180 days, has been asked to explain why its registration should not be cancelled within 30 days.The action against the NGO belonging to Teesta, who was in the forefront of the fight for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, came as a culmination of a five-month-long investigation.

"NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Thursday suspended the registration of activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010, besides serving it a notice for cancellation of FCRA licence. The grounds cited for freezing all foreign funding to the NGO include diversion of such funds to non-FCRA registered entities; using foreign contributions for purposes other than for which they were received, including for personal gains of Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand; utilization of over 50% of foreign funds received for administrative expenses and mixing its FCRA and domestic contributions, etc. As reported first by TOI on Wednesday, the Union home ministry on Thursday afternoon suspended the FCRA licence of Sabrang Trust for a period of 180 days. A simultaneous notice for cancellation of the NGO's FCRA registration was served. The action follows an inspection of Sabrang Trust's records and accounts between April 9 and 11, based on which a report was made listing the FCRA violations detected. The report was shared with the NGO on June 5 and its comments received on June 25, which the MHA has \found unsatisfactory\"". \""In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 13 of the FCRA 2010, the Central government has suspended the registration of Sabrang Trust...for a period of 180 days with effect from 10.09.2015,\"" said the home ministry order while allowing the NGO to make a representation against the said order within 30 days of its receipt. The action against Sabrang Trust comes close on the heels of Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), another NGO run by Setalvad, being placed in the prior permission list, requiring all foreign contributions to it to be pre-approved by the home ministry. Earlier, a CBI case was registered against Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL), a private firm of which Setalvad and Anand are directors. Sabrang Trust is charged with diverting Rs 50 lakh worth of foreign funds to non-FCRA registered SCPPL, which is not permitted as per the mandate of its registration under FCRA. One of the grounds cited for suspension of its FCRA licence is that Setalvad and her husband were chief functionary/trustee of the Trust but at the same time wrote articles in a magazine, \""Communalism Combat\"", published by SCPPL, violating FCRA norms. Also, the NGO spent over 64% of total donation worth Rs 48.42 lakh received in 2010-11 and 55% of Rs 49.1 lakh received in 2011-12 on administrative expenses, in excess of the 50% cap mandated under FCRA. Another violation cited is payment of Setalvad and Anand's credit card bills with funds from Sabrang Trust's FCRA-designated account, in violation of Section 8(1) of FCRA. Anand is also accused of diverting FCRA funds to pay for his medical policy and attending events such as Lahore Conference. Sabrang Trust has denied the aforesaid allegations. Setalvad had earlier described the action against her NGOs as \""politically motivated\"" and linked it to her past move to challenge the erstwhile Modi government in Gujarat over the 2002 riots."""

" New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday registered a case against civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad for allegedly receiving funds from foreign entities without registration or prior permission from the government. Other names mentioned in the FIR are Teestaβ€™s husband Javed Anand, businessman Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL). FIR comes 10 days after the home ministry asked it to probe irregularities and violation of the Foreign Contributions (Regulation) Act (FCRA) by Teesta and her NGOs. The CBI is currently examining Sabrang`s documents and bank account details, with media reports speculating that the trio may soon be questioned by the agency. A report in Times of India suggests that Teesta, Anand and Peshimam have been booked under provisions of FCRA after CBI examined the home ministry's complaint which points to prima facie \illegal diversion of funds\"". β€ Teesta Setalvad moves HC, seeks quashing of FIR over Twitter post Sources said the guilty in such cases could face imprisonment of up to five years. It is alleged that Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), both run by Teesta, received foreign contribution and this was diverted to SCPPL. Report said Sabrang Trust allegedly received around Rs 1 crore in violation of provisions of the FCRA, 1976 as well as those of FCRA, 2010. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. The agency is examining documents related to the company and bank account details besides the home ministry inspection reports of SCPPL's accounts and records for 2006-07 to 2014-15. During the probe under FCRA, Home Ministry officials found that Teesta and her husband were running a magazine \""Communalism Combat\"" as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Teesta has had a running battle with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat government since the 2002 riots. Gujarat Police had earlier accused Teesta and her husband of diverting and misusing funds received for the state's riot victims, a charge which she described as 'victimization' by the Modi government.

" Mumbai:Β  Activist Teesta Setalvad has recorded her statement before the CBI in connection with a case against her firm for allegedly receiving around US $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). She had been asked by a local court to appear before the central agency by Tuesday as on Friday special CBI Judge Anis Khan had reserved an order on the anticipatory bail applications filed by Ms Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand till Tuesday while granting them interim protection from arrest. Β  The CBI, which registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited, has alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs. 1.8 crore was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. The CBI sleuths searched four places including premises owned by Ms Setalvad, Mr Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and the office of SCPPL on July 14. The probe agency had opposed the bail plea contending the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected \interference towards the internal security and activities of India\"" and also contested Ms Setalvad's claim that the money received was a fee for consultancy. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation (a US-based NGO) and SCPPL was seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants. There is no mention of any 'consultancy' therein,\"" the CBI told the court. The CBI, which is probing the firm's accounts from 2004 to 2014, claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money received from the Ford Foundation had not been cleared by the Home Ministry. Ms Setalvad, during the July 14 searches by CBI, had termed the action by the probe agency as a \""shameful political vendetta\"". \""The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27 2015. The Naroda Patiya appeals (Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) are being heard in the Gujarat High Court tomorrow. This is nothing but a bid to subvert the cause of public justice and ensure that no justice happens in these cases,\"" she had said in a statement. According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only if it has FCRA registration. The donation was, therefore, a \""serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions, the Home Ministry had said while ordering a CBI probe.

" New Delhi: Β Amid all the legal troubles she and her husband Javed Anand face, human rights activist Teesta Setalvad is unfazed and believes that the good will finally triumph. Accusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of political vendetta, Setalvad took strong exception to the CBI calling her a \national threat\"".Β  In an interview to IANS, Setalvad said this echoed the mindset of the Narendra Modi government.Β  β€It is ludicrous and disgusting and echoes the mindset of the regime in Delhi. We are a threat only to those who believe in the politics of hatred and division,β€ she said. The CBI had registered a case against Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on July 8. The agency claimed that her firm, Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd, received around Rs.1.8 crore in donations from overseas. Countering allegations of taking money from Ford Foundation, Setalvad said she had cooperated with the investigation, giving 25,000 pages of documentary evidence.Β  \""Communalism Combat\"", the monthly magazine published by Sabrang Communications, signed an agreement with Ford Foundation in 2004 and 2006 after eminent legal counsel said this would not violate FCRA. Sabrang kept records and provided copies of the document during an inspection by FCRA in Mumbai on June 9-10. Additional documents were also posted. With the Zakia Jafri case scheduled to come up in the Gujarat High Court on July 27, Setalvad sees a political conspiracy in the CBI probe and the raid that took place at her office.Β  The petition filed by Jafri, the widow of Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed by a mob in Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Society in 2002, denounces a court-appointed Special Investigation Teamβ€™s closure report. The report ruled out the prosecution of Narendra Modi -- who was Gujarat's chief minister during the 2002 riots -- for his alleged role in the violence.Β  Setalvad felt that the cases against her was an effort to deny legal and constitutional rights to the survivors of the 2002 riots.Β  β€Last year, the Gujarat Crime Branch lodged a false FIR on 'embezzlement' on me after a magistrate rejected the protest petition of Zakia Jafri. The attempt was clearly to obstruct the filing of an appeal.Β  \""Despite all odds, our team filed the criminal revision. Now, when the matter is going to be heard, the CBI is being unleashed on us to prevent assistance to senior lawyers who will argue in the Gujarat High Court,β€ she said. Raising doubts about the role of some officers in the agency, she alleged that there was a concerted attempt to intimidate, harass and vilify her in the public domain.Β  She says this includes Ahmedabad police commissioner, Shivananad Jha, who was being held culpable -- in Jafri's petition -- for gross acts of commission on the night of February 27, 2002.Β  Ditto for A.K. Sharma, a former joint commissioner of police in Ahmedabad who she said \""was at the forefront of lodging the FIR against us in January 2014, and now he is the joint director CBI in Delhiβ€. Setalvad said she faces six \""politically motivated FIRs\"" and several other cases meant to malign her - all on the proposed memorial at the Gulberg Society.Β  β€The original complaint by some lying unutilised in the accounts. This entire chain of vindictive actions began and is aggressively pressed by the Ahmedabad police,β€ she said. Dismissing allegations that she has been targeting Narendra Modi, Setalvad said her allegations were based on evidences, collated from the affidavits of serving police officers, from the National Human Rights Commission, and the report and evidence before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, Crimes Against Humanity, 2002. Setalvad said he affirms her faith in the triumph of justice.Β  β€In the 13 years since the Gujarat violence, we fought 68 cases. It has resulted in 120 convictions up to life imprisonment and had created path-breaking jurisprudence empowering the rights of citizens and survivors.β€Gulberg victims was of Rs.4.6 lakhs collected for a dream project, the Gulberg Memorial.

" New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government is all set to cancel the registration of Teesta Setalvad's NGO, Sabrang Trust, for serious violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA). However, activist's another NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) would be let off by placing it in the prior permission list, keeping in view the lesser intensity of the rule violations. According to a TOI report, the suspension order of Sabrang's FCRA registration as well as cancellation notice are ready and will be issued next week. The CBI registered a case against Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of FCRA on July 8. The agency claimed that her firm, Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd, received around Rs 1.8 crore in donations from using $2,50,000 worth of foreign contribution received from Ford Foundation for purposes other than for what it was permitted to under the Act. The trust is alleged to have used the Ford grant to identify and lobby with 100 mediaperons to \address communalism and caste-based discrimination in India,\"" while being registered under FCRA as an \""educational and social\"" organisation However, another NGO associated with Setalvad, CJP's rule violations were found be of lesser nature by the Home Ministry as compared to Sabrang. CJP had received a small amount from Sabrang Trust and used it for purposes other than for which were intended. Certain accounting anomalies were also detected during inspection of CJP office and book of accounts, said sources. Β  The CBI is already investigating FCRA violations by Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL), of which Teesta is a director. SCPPL is alleged to have received Ford Foundation contribution worth $2,90,000 in violation of FCRA provisions, as the firm is not registered under FCRA and hence cannot receive foreign funding. Teesta has had a running battle with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat government since the 2002 riots. Gujarat Police had earlier accused Teesta and her husband of diverting and misusing funds received for the state's riot victims, a charge which she described as 'victimization' by the Modi government.

 New Delhi: After a special CBI court rejected anticipatory bail plea of human rights activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, Bombay High Court today gave them some relief and extended her interim bail for two more weeks. Teesta had moved to HC after the CBI court refused to grant him anticipatory bail in a case against her firm for allegedly receiving around US $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The CBI registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited alleging SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the court that they were innocent and were falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them is to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI in their reply, last Friday, had said that motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India. β€Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communitiesβ€, the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation. She had been asked by a local court to appear before the central agency by Tuesday as on Friday special CBI Judge Anis Khan had reserved an order on the anticipatory bail applications filed by Ms Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand till Tuesday while granting them interim protection from arrest. During the hearing in CBI court, Setalvad alleged that the FIR registered against her and her husband was for the purpose of harassing and torturing them, a charge rejected by CBI. β€The applicants are deliberately mixing up the offences alleged against them with non-related issues in order to divert the attention from the serious charges against them,β€ the agency had said. The CBI had also told the court that when their premises were searched on July 14 this year there was total resistance and non-cooperation from their side. β€During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation and SCPPL were seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants. There is no mention of any β€consultancyβ€™ therein,β€ the reply had said.

The Supreme Court on Thursday extended the stay on the arrest of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband in the ongoing probe over the misappropriation of public funds, while has been filed against them. The apex court also referred Setalvad's anticipatory bail plea in the case to a larger bench. Last month, the Supreme Court had directed the Gujarat Police to provide Setalvad and her husband a list of documents needed from them. The court had told the Gujarat Police that the accused are also entitled to have the list, which has already made available to the Supreme Court. An FIR had reportedly been lodged last year against Setalwad, her husband Javed Anand and Tanvir Jafri, son of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri (who was killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots), for allegedly embezzling funds meant for a museum for the victims of the incident.
"AHMEDABAD β€” Gujarat Minister of State for Home Rajni Patel on Wednesday accused Teesta Setalvad of misusing funds given to her NGO by the US-based Ford Foundation and said a report of the same has been sent to the Central Government. \The money which was given to her has been spent to spread lies against the Gujarat Government, tarnishing the image of India in international circles, and also to spread communal disharmony.

Now it is up to the Central Government to take action,\"" Patel said. \""During the investigation of Gulberg Society museum funds embezzlement case, these things came to light. In April, we filed a case against her and as of now the case is going on in the Supreme Court and the courts will decide what has to be done,\"" he added. Meanwhile, Teesta Setalvad said that she and her NGO cooperated fully with the Gujarat government. \""We received a letter from the FCRA department. A four member team headed by a Deputy Secretary came to our offices in Mumbai and was here for one whole week. They have inspected our records and we have provided full cooperation and now they will decide what to do.

"NEW DELHI β€” The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday justified the decision of the government to put private funding organisation Ford Foundation on its watch list, adding that compared to other countries, India is very a 'liberal regime' with respect to foreign donations. \The Ford Foundation and a few other international donor organisations have been put on the prior permission list, which means that any donations flowing to the Indian NGOs have to be first assessed by the Government of India. This has been done because there has been a violation of the India law Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act,\"" BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao told ANI. \""Throughout the world, foreign donations are being regulated. India has a very liberal regime. We are only enforcing the implementations of guidelines and the provisions of the FCRA,\"" he added. Elaborating on how Ford Foundation violated the FCRA, Narasimha Rao said that the organisation had made an 'illegal' donation of around Rs three crore. \""One company with which Teesta Setalvad was associated, Sabrang Communications and Publishing Limited, was given nearly USD 300,000, which comes to around Rs three crore, and this organisation does not have the permission to receive foreign grants, thus violating the existing provisions of the Act,\"" he said. Earlier this week, the Ministry of Home Affairs placed Ford Foundation on its watch list on the basis of inputs received from security agencies. According to reports, the ministry found the foundation to be in 'serious violation' of the FCRA and asked the Reserve Bank of India to instruct all banks of the same, in order to ensure that any funds from the organisation be brought to the ministry's notice.

"LONDON β€” India has put the US-based Ford Foundation, one of the world's largest charitable funds, onto a security watchlist as it probes its funding of a local organisation run by a prominent activist and critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The home affairs ministry said it would \keep watch on all the activities\"" funded by the Ford Foundation and instructed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to check with the government before passing any money from the New York-based group to local organisations. All funds distributed by the foundation should be \""utilized for bonafide welfare activities without compromising on concerns for national interest and security\"", the ministry said in a letter to the RBI published online. The Ford Foundation, which has worked in India since 1952, said the Indian government was \""reviewing information related to their ongoing investigation of Sabrang Communications and Publishing\"" and highlighted its work in India. \""We are confident in our work and compliance with the law and look forward to the outcome of this inquiry,\"" the foundation said in a statement on Friday. \""We have been and continue to be deeply respectful of the laws of the land ... If the Government suggests methods by which we can strengthen and improve our grant-making processes, we will take appropriate steps to incorporate them.\"" No one from the Indian government was immediately available to comment further. Sabrang, which is run by activist Teesta Setalvad with a mission to strengthen conflict resolution and peace building in Gujarat and Maharashtra, was given $250,000 by the Ford Foundation in 2009, the foundation's website said. Last week Sabrang was accused by a state minister from Gujarat of misusing funds to create \""communal disharmony\"", local media reported. Setalvad and her husband are fighting accusations covered in the India media of embezzling funds meant for a museum to honour victims of the 2002 riots in Gujarat which led to the deaths of almost 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Setalvad is a long-time critic of Modi who was chief minister of Gujarat during the riots. Human rights groups and political rivals have long alleged that Modi, a Hindu, allowed or even actively encouraged the 2002 violence but he has always vehemently denied the charge, and a Supreme Court inquiry found no evidence to prosecute him. The Ford Foundation had almost $12 billion in assets at the end of 2013, and provides grants to groups in the United States, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, focusing on education, democracy promotion and poverty reduction. This is not the first time the Indian government has blocked foreign money to a local non-government organisation this year with funding to the local branch of Greenpeace blocked. The move came after several months of Greenpeace activists accusing Modi's government of watering down environmental rules after it let industries operate closer to protected green zones.

"WASHINGTON β€” The United States today expressed concern over India's crackdown on Ford Foundation and Greenpeace, and said it is seeking \clarification\"" on the action. \""We are aware that the (Indian) Ministry of Home Affairs suspended the registration of Greenpeace India and has placed the Ford Foundation on a prior permission watch list,\"" the State Department Deputy Acting Spokesperson, Marie Harf, told reporters at her daily news conference. \""We remain concerned about the difficulties caused to civil society organisations by the manner in which the Foreign Contributions Regulations Act has been applied,\"" she said in response to a question. \""We are concerned that this recent ruling limits the necessary and critical debate within Indian society and we are seeking a clarification on this issue with the appropriate Indian authorities,\"" Harf said.

"Scores of civil society groups today launched a stinging attack on the Modi government for cancelling licences of nearly 9,000 NGOs and vowed to counter such \persecution\"" unitedly. The civil society groups met under the banner of 'Janadhikar Sangharsh Samiti', to protest what it called the government's \""frontal attack on the Right to Expression, Association and Dissension\"". In a crackdown on NGOs receiving foreign funds, the government has cancelled licences of nearly 9,000 such entities for violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Slamming the government action, the organisations at the meeting pledged to explore all possible legal options as part of their fight against the crackdown. \""The issue is not related to the source of our funding or FCRA. It is a larger political issue under which NGOs are being targeted and persecuted for working, as well as, raising the voice of the poor, weak and the deprived,\"" said Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai, who was offloaded from a flight to London in January. She said time has come to take action to \""reclaim democratic political space for dissent\"" and vowed to continue the fight \""till the end\"". Pillai also shared her experience of government crackdown on Greenpeace as well as being stopped at New Delhi airport from boarding a flight to London. Anil Chaudhary, coordinator of Indian Social Action Forum (INSAF), said government action to crush dissent will be countered effectively. \""Task groups are being created to take legal action. But more importantly, we have resolved to battle such moves till the end,\"" Chaudhary said. Javed Anand of Sabrang trust, with which civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad is also associated, accused the government of following an \""authoritarian ideology\"". Professor Achin Vanaik of Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace (CNDP) said it was necessary to protect the minorities. \""By minorities, we do not mean only religious minorities, but also dalits, tribals, and all those deprived sections who have suffered much during their fight for livelihood,\"" Vanaik added. The US-based Ford Foundation has also been put in the 'watch list' last week by the Home Ministry which directed that funds coming from the international donor should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from it."""

"MUMBAI -- A special CBI court here today rejected the anticipatory bail application of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband filed in connection with a case alleging that her company received Rs1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. \The anticipatory bail application is rejected,\"" said Special Judge Anis Khan. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand had moved the court for bail on July 17. Setalvad told the court that she was shocked. \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers .\"" On July 8, the CBI had registered a case against Setalvad and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs1.8 crore was received in violation of the Act since the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the court that they were falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them is to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI has said that the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India. \""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation.

"A miasma of impending gloom envelops the Indian horizons. The extreme right-wing fanatics seem to have embarked with brazen brutality on their quest to liquidate modern intellectuals, and are likely to be involved in the deaths of MM Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. But India's current political leadership has maintained a calculated silence. For the BJP, anything remotely liberal that challenges traditional rigidities deserves instant condemnation and retaliation, a bonfire of the vanities. PM Modi made smart political capital of the much-exaggerated economic doldrums story in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to make susceptible Indians believe that he had a magic panacea for every ill that plagued the nation. Development was always just a canny subterfuge for the real agenda of Hindutva. The dangerous narrative is currently playing out in your nearest neighbourhood. The change in India post-May 2014 is palpable -- NGOs are being hounded out, Gujarat riot activist Teesta Setalvad has been targeted and individual freedoms are being threatened, cases in point being the beef ban, Ghar Wapsi and the attempted porn ban. \Today, the RSS runs the world's most exciting emerging market... In a country of a 172 million Muslims, not one occupies the BJP's 282 seats in the Lok Sabha.\"" When serious corruption allegations engulfed his senior party leaders, Modi acted predictably sanctimonious and chose the option of stubborn denial. BJP trolls on social media have gone so far as to even threaten vulgar violence against women journalists. Is this what 31% of Indians voted for? Last week's BJP-RSS meeting conjured up some hilarious imagery: ministers making PPT presentations to pracharaks, perhaps lying prostrate in some complex yoga position. But that's just my imagination. What is not imagined is the danger of India's destiny being in the hands of an unelected, unconstitutional lot, who believe in Hindu Rashtra. Interestingly, this is what BJP MP MJ Akbar wrote in his book Riot After Riot: \""RSS represents Hindu revivalism of the worst sort; the most dangerous, clandestine force, determined to provoke violence\"". Today, the RSS runs the world's most exciting emerging market, which global hedge fund manager Jim Rogers just quit, lock, stock and barrel. In a country of a 172 million Muslims, not one occupies the BJP's 282 seats in the Lok Sabha. Are you really surprised? The RSS -- registered as a charitable, social and cultural organisation -- has perceptible political intent; the five-year window is a litmus test to see a social transformation; the \""Indianisation\"" process. Modi needs to earn saffron stripes for foot soldiers for the 2019 elections. A quid pro quo deal exists, so India's prime institutions are up for RSS infiltration -- FTII, NCERT, UGC, ICHR, NBT, CFS, IITs, IIMs etc. Rahul Gandhi called the RSS a non-state actor, whose hand in Samjhauta Express and Malegaon blasts etc are still smouldering into the twilight sky. Don't forget: Modi's Gujarat government had legally contested Sachar Committee recommendations to help Muslim minorities as an unconstitutional diktat. The RSS were naturally pleased with their former illustrious pracharak. The decision to idolise Sardar Patel, who banned the RSS, revealed the consummate sinister capabilities of the RSS/BJP to hijack history and market a disingenuous debate. When Mohan Bhagwat spoke to the country using the state broadcaster Doordarshan last year, Modi in essence publicly admitted who his political guardians were going to be. \""When a state starts to treat its vulnerable minorities with recurring hate-speeches from its party members, periodic threats and institutionalised demonising, we are creating conditions for a dangerous explosion.\"" There are several concomitant developments that manifest a calibrated political strategy to create a polarised society. The unlimited supply of vitriol from Giriraj Singh, Sakshi Maharaj, Sadhvi Jyoti, Yogi Adityanath etc keep the pot-boiling at intermittent intervals, a constant reminder that the core agenda is never too far away. In Bihar, 670 communal disturbances have occurred since BJP parted ways with Nitish Kumar - it cannot be a mere coincidence. Is the BJP and the PM endorsing the repeat of the Muzaffarnagar model ? The targeting of Vice President Hamid Ansari by Ram Madhav on Yoga Day was an abysmal low. A twisted argument to alter Nehru Memorial Museum by adding Hindutva icons reveals RSS-BJP's paranoia about the enduring popularity of the man who championed secular democracy. Dismantling Nehru is their favourite obsession. When a state starts to treat its vulnerable minorities with recurring hate-speeches from its party members, periodic threats and institutionalised demonising, we are creating conditions for a dangerous explosion. In the age of social media that can have destructive repercussions. It is a recipe for a communal conflagration. We have never been more polarised as a nation, as we are now. Noted author Mukul Kesavan says, \""Hindutva is a bid to take over the State in the name of the Hindu majority. It is a coup in slow motion\"". Right now, let there be no mistake, it is gathering speed. The RSS and BJP have an inalienable umbilical cord, a retrograde, regressive majoritarian construct in mind, and prescriptions based on religious identity for India, from which a comeback might take an exponentially longer time. A susceptible demographic dividend that can be easily influenced is their low-hanging fruit. Honestly, Nagpur should be the new capital of India. Then even a remote control becomes redundant.

Members of the district unit of the Karnataka Komu Sauharda Vedike staged a dharna in front of the Clock Tower protesting against, what they termed the β€assault on civil rights by the Modi government,β€ here on Friday. K. Phaniraj, vice-president of the district unit of the vedike, said that ever since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, there had been a systematic effort to muzzle the voice of non-government organisations (NGOs) and civil society groups, which it saw as hostile to its agenda. Targeting Among the worst-hit NGOs was the Citizens for Justice and Peace headed by civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad. This organisation was being hounded ever since it took up the cause of the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The targeting of Citizens for Justice and Peace was still continuing. All kinds of flimsy charges had been made against Ms. Setalvad and the organisation. This was just an example of how the Modi government treated the NGOs and civil society groups, he said. Pressure G. Rajashekhar, writer and president of the district unit of the vedike, said that influential quarters had pressured Rohini Salian, the Special Public Prosecutor in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, to go soft on the case after the Modi gfovernment came to power. The treatment meted out to the rights activist G.N. Saibaba was a mirror to the scant regard for basic human rights in the country, he said.   β€Systematic efforts to muzzle the voice of NGOsβ€™
The company received foreign funds without FCRA registration, it is charged.Following the Union Home Ministry recommendation, the CBI on Wednesday registered a case against Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited, represented by its directors Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and others, for alleged illegal receipt and use of foreign funds. β€We have registered a case of alleged conspiracy and violation of various provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act . Those named are the directors of Sabrang Communications, Ms. Setalvad, her husband Mr. Anand, and Peshimam Gulam Mohammed, besides other unknown persons,β€ said a CBI official. The agency has alleged that Sabrang Communications received funds from foreign donors without a valid FCRA registration or prior clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The agency may soon summon the company directors for questioning. According to an MHA report, Ms. Setalvadβ€™s organisations, Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, received foreign funds of over Rs.1 crore between 2008 and 2014, and the money was diverted from stated purposes in violation of FCRA provisions.
The CBI on Tuesday carried out searches at premises of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her organisation in connection with a case of alleged violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in receiving funds from abroad without taking prior permission from the Home Ministry. The CBI sleuths carried out searches at four places in Mumbai at the premises of Ms. Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and office of Sabrang Communications and Publishing, a move flayed by the social activist who said that she was cooperating with the CBI. β€We are surprised and shocked at this,β€ Ms. Setalvad said, adding, β€We have been offering full cooperation.β€ The CBI had registered a case on July 8 against all these under IPC Section related to criminal conspiracy (120-B) along with provisions of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 1976. β€We had written a letter to CBI offering full cooperation and telling the agency that whatever so-called offences are registered against us, we will cooperate. So we donβ€™t understand the rationale behind this entire operation,β€ Ms. Setalvad. β€We believe that it is a caged-parrot in operation and it is a political vendetta and they are trying to humiliate and intimidate us,β€ she said. The CBI sources said in New Delhi that the case was registered after the agency completed verification of all the documents submitted by the Home Ministry while referring the probe to the agency.
"Premises of social activist and company directors raidedThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday carried out searches on the premises of social activist Teesta Setalvad and other directors of her publishing company in connection with alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). According to the Union Home Ministry, though the company was not registered under the Act and had no prior permission from the Ministry, it received funds from foreign donors, which includes the Ford Foundation. β€After obtaining court warrants, the agency conducted searches on the official and residential premises of the directors of Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited in Mumbai. The company is represented by directors, Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, besides Peshimam Gulam Mohammed,β€ said a senior CBI official. The agency claims to have seized some documents β€confirmingβ€ allegations against the firm that it violated FCRA rules by receiving foreign funds without authorisation. According to MHA findings, donations to the tune of $2.9 lakh from the Ford Foundation were accepted without permission. The company and its representatives have been booked for alleged conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and violations under various provisions of the FCRA-2010, and the FCRA-1976. The provisions provide for a maximum of five yearsβ€™ imprisonment or fine, or both. The CBI is currently scrutinising the companyβ€™s financial transactions for the period 2004-2014. Based on an MHA complaint, the agency registered the case on July 8 alleging violations by Sabrang Communications. The Home Ministry earlier conducted an inquiry into the allegations and found that Ms. Setalvadβ€™s organisations had received foreign funds of over Rs.1 crore between 2007-8 and 2014-15, and that the money was allegedly diverted from stated purposes in violation of FCRA provisions. Shubhomoy Sikdar reports from Mumbai: β€In our view, and we repeat, no laws have been broken by us. This is a continuation of the persecution and witch-hunt first launched by the Gujarat police in 2014 then under the dispensation that rules Delhi. The CBI has taken the same documents that we had voluntarily, on inspection, given the MHA (FCRA dept). Over 25,000 pages of documentary evidence has been given to the Gujarat Police. When they could not succeed with the bizarre and desperate attempts to gain custody (February 2015), it was the Gujarat Government's Home Department that wrote to the MHA and the current round of the persecutions began,β€ Ms. Setalvad said in a statement late on Tuesday, claiming that CBI officials continued with the search operation late in the night. β€It is shameful political vendetta. The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27, 2015. The Naroda Patiya appeals involving Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi are being heard in the Gujarat High Court tomorrow. This is nothing but a bid to subvert the cause of public justice and ensure that no justice happens in these cases,\ she said."""
"A leading global charity has frozen $4 million in funding to India, squeezing aid to the poor, after a clampdown by Centre on donors deemed to be meddling in domestic politics that has raised concern in Washington. The government restrictions on the U.S.-based Ford Foundation relate to a $250,000 grant to a vocal Modi critic, but a top official at the charity said the fallout has hit projects that fight child marriage, provide clean water in slums and feed pregnant women. \We don't want to move ahead until the time we are clear about the rules and nothing we do is viewed as illegal,\"" the official said, requesting anonymity. The Ford Foundation has donated more than $500 million to India since opening its first overseas office in Delhi in 1952. Its headquarters in New York did not respond to requests for comment about the decision to hold back funds. India has toughened rules governing charities, and this year the government cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 groups for failing to declare details of overseas donations. The Narendra Modi government has accused foreign charities of trying to hamper industrial projects on social and environmental grounds, and he has criticised what he called \""five-star activists.\"" Greenpeace India is among those affected, with bank accounts frozen and travel restrictions on some workers after it campaigned against issues including coal mining and nuclear power, areas Mr. Modi sees as key to economic growth. Under a proposed law, foreign-funded NGOs face more regulatory hurdles and must agree their work will not be \""detrimental to the national interest.\"" Activists say the term is not clearly defined, leaving it open to abuse. \""Chilling effect\"" Amid the crackdown, the Home Ministry put the $12.5 billion Ford Foundation on a watch list this year over funding it gave to activist Teesta Setalvad in 2009. At the time she was pursuing legal cases against Mr. Modi, accusing him of failing to stop anti-Muslim rioting that killed at least 1,000 people when he was chief minister of Gujarat. On Tuesday, CBI personnel raided Ms. Setalvad's home after filing a criminal case against her last week for allegedly misusing the Ford Foundation grant. She could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. B.K. Prasad, the official overseeing the home ministry's new approach, told Reuters the government had no intention of forcing NGOs to close. \""But we have every right to streamline their work,\"" he said. \""This attitude that nobody can question influential foreign donors must be put to an end.\"" U.S. Ambassador Richard Verma has said the United States was in dialogue with India on the matter, and he warned that the tougher approach may have a \""chilling effect\"" on civil society and democratic traditions. There are signs that may be happening already. At a meeting in New Delhi a week ago, the Ford Foundation told groups it funds to avoid words like \""governance\"", \""advocacy\"" or \""human rights\"" in reports and proposals, said a person who attended."""
The district unit of Karnataka Komu Sauharda Vedike (KKSV) has condemned the raid by the CBI on the publishing firm of social activist Teesta Setalvad for the alleged violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on July 14. In a press release issued here on Wednesday, G. Rajashekhar, president of district unit of KKSV, said that the raid on the premises of Ms. Setalvad and other directors of the firm was done solely for political purposes. The intention of this raid was to break the back of Ms. Setalavadβ€™s organisations, which had carried on a legal fight against violation of human rights. The CBI raid was a despicable act by the Union government to crush just struggles and protect violators of law, he said. If such acts went on unhindered, it would shake the foundations of the legal justice system, Constitution and civil rights. The President of the country should take a serious note of these developments and intervene to protect civil law and rights, the release added.

Opposing the anticipatory bail application of social activist Teesta Setalvad, the Central Bureau of Investigation told a sessions court here, in a reply filed on Friday, that she was a threat to national security. β€The CBI has filed a ridiculous reply. They said they want to interrogate her and that she is a threat to national security,β€ Ms. Setalvadβ€™s lawyer Vijay Hiremath told The Hindu. The CBI had registered a case against Ms. Setalvad in connection with alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Ms. Setalvad subsequently approached the court for anticipatory bail. On Friday, the court granted her protection from arrest till July 21, when it will pass an order on the bail application, Mr. Hiremath said. Only July 8, the CBI had carried out searches at various premises linked to social activist Ms. Setalvad. The agency alleged that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt., Limited (SCPPL) received around Rs. 1.8 crore in foreign donations in violation of FCRA as SCPPL was not registered under the Act.

The CBI claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money received from the Ford Foundation had not been cleared by the Home Ministry.Activist Teesta Setalvad on Monday recorded her statement before the CBI in connection with a case against her firm for allegedly receiving around $2.9 lakh in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). She had been asked by a local court to appear before the central agency by Tuesday as on Friday special CBI Judge Anis Khan had reserved an order on the anticipatory bail applications filed by Ms. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand till Tuesday while granting them interim protection from arrest. The CBI, which registered a case on July 8 against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited, has alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore ($2.9 lakh) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval of the Union Home Ministry. The CBI sleuths searched four places including premises owned by Ms. Setalvad, Mr. Anand, an associate Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and the office of SCPPL on July 14. The probe agency had opposed the bail plea contending the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected β€interference towards the internal security and activities of Indiaβ€ and also contested Ms. Setalvadβ€™s claim that the money received was a fee for consultancy. β€During the search, an agreement dated September 22, 2006 between Ford Foundation (a US-based NGO) and SCPPL was seized which clearly showed that the remittances were grants. There is no mention of any β€consultancyβ€™ therein,β€ the CBI told the court. The CBI, which is probing the firmβ€™s accounts from 2004 to 2014, claimed to have recovered documents showing that the money received from the Ford Foundation had not been cleared by the Home Ministry. Ms. Setalvad, during the July 14 searches by CBI, had termed the action by the probe agency as aβ€ shameful political vendettaβ€. β€The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27 2015.

A day before Teesta Setalvadβ€™s anticipatory bail plea in the alleged Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) violation case comes up for hearing at a sessions court here, the social activist was called by the CBI for questioning at its regional office here on Monday. Along with Ms. Setalvad her husband Javed Anand, who has been named by the agency in the case, was also questioned. This is the third time in the past three days that the couple was called to the CBI office, said her colleagues. Coming out of the CBI office after the questioning session which lasted nearly two hours, Ms. Setalvad refused to speak to the media.
Police have accused the couple of non-cooperation and supplying limited documents.The Gujarat Police opposed anticipatory bail given to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband by the Supreme Court, accusing the couple of misappropriating charity funds meant for rehabilitation of the 2002 Godhra riots victims for their personal use. In an affidavit before the apex court, the Gujarat Police said the couple allegedly diverted funds collected through their trusts β€” Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice and Peace (CJP). It said the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulbarg society, devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of β€very personal natureβ€ have been debited by them under the head β€Secular Educationβ€ or β€Legal Aid Expenses.β€ It said the probe is supported by evidence like vouchers having dates and amounts incurred on consumption of liquor, dining out and purchase of personal items, from novels to phone and clothes. The affidavit said 45 per cent of total funds received by the Sabrang Trust in 2008-13 have gone to Setalvad and her husband either directly or through Sabrang Communication Pvt Limited (SCPPL) which was fully owned by them. Police have accused the couple of non-cooperation and supplying limited documents.
NGO was put under the β€prior permissionβ€ category in the interest of β€national securityβ€Months after its clampdown on the U.S.-based Ford Foundation, the Centre has unblocked foreign funds totalling $150,000 to be released to the foreign donorβ€™s bank accounts. The Union Home Ministry put the foundation under the β€prior permissionβ€ category in April in the interest of β€national securityβ€. In what is being seen as a softening of stand against the powerful international non-governmental organisation, the Ministry gave it the go-ahead to release funds as the organisation made a plea to the government after exhausting its options even to pay salaries. The foundationβ€™s representatives recently met Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, and explained their position. Since the foundation is not registered as an NGO in India, it was asked to register itself under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, if it intended to receive foreign funds in its accounts. The NGO was put on the governmentβ€™s watch list after the Gujarat government, in its report to the Union Home Ministry in March, said it funded β€anti-Indiaβ€ activities of Teesta Setalvadβ€™s two NGOs β€” Citizens for Justice and Peace and Sabrang Trust. Gujaratβ€™s Minister of State for Home Rajnikant Patel had said that the foundation donated more than $5 lakh to Ms. Setalvadβ€™s NGOs. β€We decided to unblock funds so that their staffers here in India could be paid their salaries. They also agreed to register themselves under FEMA,β€ a senior Home Ministry official said. In May, U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma expressed β€concernβ€ at the β€potentially chilling effectsβ€ of the regulatory steps taken against NGOs here. β€We have not buckled under any kind of pressure. We have only released the salary component. They continue to be on the governmentβ€™s watch list,β€ the Ministry official said. The foundation had earlier argued for continuation of the practice under which it was allowed to operate merely on the basis of an understanding with the Department of Economic Affairs. The unblocking of foreign funds would mean that it would be able to receive money in its American Express and Citibank accounts.
: Social activist Teesta Setalvad on Tuesday alleged that Centre was directing the Central Bureau of Investigation to repeatedly call her for questioning as it would prevent her from listing the evidence in the Zakia Jafri case on the Gujarat riots, scheduled for a crucial hearing on July 27. Ms. Setalvad made the remarks after she was summoned for questioning for the fourth consecutive day by the CBI at its regional office here. Her anticipatory bail plea was to come up for hearing at a local court earlier in the day but it was adjourned to Friday, thus extending the interim bail. Soon after, she and her husband Javed Anand were called by the CBI for questioning. Ms. Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, has challenged a lower court order giving a clean chit to Mr. Modi and others in connection with the 2002 riots in the Gujarat High Court and needs to submit the evidence by July 23.

Nearly 100 prominent activists and writers have contributed their names for a signature campaign demanding the end to the β€political vendettaβ€ against Gujarat-activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand. On July 13, the Central Bureau of Investigation raided the houses of the two activists, who have been active in pursuing legal cases against the perpetrators of the 2002 Gujarat riots, on the charges of misappropriation of funds meant for riot victims. Writer Girish Karnad, actor G.K. Govind Rao, scholars and activists in the city have condemned the raids and termed them a β€political vendetta.β€ The State has misused investigative agencies to β€intimidate, terrorise and harassβ€ the activists, a statement said.
On a day when the Bombay High Court granted interim protection from arrest to social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a case related to violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), the Home Ministry put one of her other NGOs β€” the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) under the β€prior approval category.β€™ Fridayβ€™s order essentially means that the CJP would not be able to receive foreign funds without the Ministryβ€™s approval. Officials said they were in the process of sending a show-cause notice to CJP and Sabrang Trust, another NGO run by Ms. Setalvad. Earlier in April this year, on a complaint by the Gujarat government that the U.S.-based Ford Foundation was funding the β€anti-Indiaβ€ activities of Ms. Setalvadβ€™s NGOs, the Home Ministry inspected their accounts. The State government had requested that registration of both the NGOs be cancelled. Ms. Setalvadβ€™s relentless legal battle to seek justice for the victims of the 2002 communal riots has been a source of annoyance, her friends allege, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was Gujarat Chief Minister then. Ms. Setalvad was assisting Zakia Jafri, widow of former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri who was killed in the 2002 Gulberg Society massacre, to file a petition against Mr. Modi and 59 others on their alleged complicity in the riots, which was later rejected by the court. The Communist Party of India (CPI-M) had earlier condemned the β€blatantly vindictiveβ€ actions against Ms Setalvad by the Modi government. Earlier in the day, a CBI court in Mumbai had rejected her anticipatory bail application and a plea for interim protection, after which Ms. Setalvad approached the High Court. Justice Mridula Bhatkar gave interim relief till August 10, when the court will hear Ms. Setalvadβ€™s application challenging the order of the CBI court. Noting that her passport was already deposited with the Gujarat police, the High Court Bench did not see the possibility of Ms. Setalvad absconding. Justice Bhatkar rejected outright the CBIβ€™s repeated requests for daily interrogation of Ms. Setalvad during the period of interim relief. The court directed the activists to remain present at the CBI office for interrogation on July 27 and 30, and August 3 and 6 from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. The CBI told the High Court that Ms. Setalvadβ€™s offences β€were of a serious nature which may be a threat to the economy.β€ In an earlier reply, the agency had called her a threat to national security. According to the investigating agency her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt., Limited (SCPPL), a private company owned by the couple received foreign donations even though it was not Foreign Contribution Regulation Act compliant. The activistβ€™s lawyer Mihir Desai pointed out that the Ford Foundation, which gave the funds was not a suspect organisation and Ms. Setalvad had taken a written opinion of a senior counsel before accepting foreign money. β€Even IITs and IIMs receive funds from the foundation,β€ Mr. Desai told the court. Earlier, the CBI court rejected her anticipatory bail plea on the ground that a prima facie case was made out against her and that the offences against her were of a serious nature. It took note of the fact that the complainant against her was the government of India (Deputy Secretary, Home Ministry) and therefore β€not an ordinary person.β€ β€The case is serious. Documentary evidence has to be seized and custodial interrogation is needed,β€ Special CBI judge Anis Khan observed.
In an interview to The Hindu a few days ago, she said that under the Modi regime the future is dark for activists.Arguably the face of the fight for justice for the victims of the Gujarat riots in 2002, Teesta Setalvad has tirelessly fought scores of cases, provided legal aid to the survivors through her non-governmental organisations and played a role in securing conviction of 120 perpetrators. But today, she is accused of forgery and criminal breach of trust, facing multiple inquiries and six FIRs. Her organisational and personal accounts were frozen in early 2014, and a travel ban was imposed recently.  You are accused of cheating those very people whom you fought for β€¦  None of the allegations made by the Gujarat Police Crime Branch has stood the test of documentary evidence [running into 25,000 pages] supplied by us. There is no charge sheet, just intimidation, harassment and vilification in the public domain. This entire chain of vindictive actions aggressively pressed by the Ahmedabad Police Crime Branch began in January 2013 when our accounts were illegally frozen; when desperate attempts to get us into custody failed. When this ploy failed, the Gujarat Home Department wrote to the Union Home Affairs Ministryβ€™s FCRA [Foreign Contribution Regulation Act] Division and a spate of inspections ensued.  This is being driven by those who are irked at the concrete results we achieved post-2002, further enraged that all attempts to silence us have so far failed.   Your NGOs Sabrang Communications and Citizens for Justice and Peace have been accused of receiving funds in violation of the FCRA and using the money for anti-India sentiments.  We have broken no laws. Section 3 of the FCRA, 2010, bars certain categories, including political parties and registered newspapers, from receiving foreign donations. However, Section (4) says that it will not apply if the foreign contribution is received in the form of salary or wages. Sabrang Communications, which published the monthly Communalism Combat, signed a consultancy agreement with the Ford Foundation in 2004 and 2006 to address the issues of caste and communalism through a clearly defined set of activities which had nothing whatsoever to do with Communalism Combat or remuneration to Javed Anand or Teesta Setalvad towards discharging editorial/managerial functions. The consultancy was signed by Sabrang Communications only after advice from eminent legal counsel that such an agreement was covered under the exclusion stipulated under Section 4 of the Act and, therefore, the consultancy fees (not grant or donation) received would not be in violation of the Act.   You say you are subjected to a witch-hunt by the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo because of your unrelenting fight for justice in Gujarat.  I have been a specific hate target. An FIR, in our view malicious and motivated, was lodged over 18 months ago at the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, that simply speaks of funds collected for the Gulberg Memorial. This princely sum of Rs. 4.6 lakh is still lying unutilised due to our inability to take this dream project forward. To date, despite over 24,000 pages of documentary evidence being filed, there is no charge sheet.  Did you face similar suppression under the UPA or Vajpayee regimes?  No. In fact, in December 2000, Communalism Combat was honoured with the Prince Claus International Award for Exceptional Initiative in the field of Journalism and Development. Believing in the law, we applied for permission to receive the award amount and were duly granted that permission. In 2003, I was co-recipient of the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award, and we had an NDA government in power in Delhi. We applied for due permission from the Home Ministry and then received the amount.    Under the Modi government, is the future dark for activists?  Yes.    On accusations of being a Congress stooge?  It was the brute post-Babri Masjid demolition that led us to take the step into exploratory journalism. Which government was in power in Bombay in 1992-93? Who were among the several groups to lead the campaign for punishment to the perpetrators? It was us. Who was at the forefront to ensure that evidence before Justice B.N Srikrishna actually got filed? Whether it is 1992-93 Bombay or 1984 Delhi, we have taken a clear-cut position against the politics of communalism, whether it stems from the majority or the minority.
Why have the killers of Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh, who have the political backing of the Tamil Nadu and Punjab governments, been shown clemency?When a thick rope is wound around 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memonβ€™s neck in Nagpur jail, on his 53rd birthday, we can expect to be bombarded with grotesque details of his last moments: his final words, his last meal, or his manner of walk to the gallows. Then there will be jingoistic fireworks, vulgar chest-thumping and loud proclamations of β€justice servedβ€™. Yet, many of those who rue the death penalty as barbaric, as well as those who believe that Yakub is undeserving of such a sentence, will see their voices dimmed. Public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam (who infamously cooked up the story of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack accused Ajmal Kasabβ€™s demand for biryani) has hailed the verdict to deny Yakub a reprieve as β€historicβ€, saying it will send across a strong message to Pakistan. Justice P.D. Kode, who passed the execution judgement in 2007, says it will β€restore the common manβ€™s faith in justice.β€ Some argue that Yakubβ€™s death will bring some closure to the families of the victims. But what point will Yakubβ€™s death really prove? Indiaβ€™s secular fabric was stained when politically driven Hindutva extremists demolished the 400-year-old Babri Masjid in December 1992 and slaughtered many innocent people. Deadly riots consequently broke out in Mumbai and other parts of the country consuming over 1,000 lives, mostly Muslims. As β€retributionβ€™ for these events, Mumbai was ripped apart by 13 devastating blasts on a Black Friday in March 1993. More than 250 innocent lives were lost and hundreds were injured in a dastardly act of terror. The top conspirators of the blasts, including Yakubβ€™s brother Ibrahim β€Tigerβ€ Memon and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, are absconding. Yakub, who had fled India with his family a couple of days before the blasts, did not pay heed to his brotherβ€™s warnings and decided to return to his β€homelandβ€ in 1994 to prove his innocence. He chose to leave behind a protected life under the Inter-Services Intelligence in Pakistan. Only a person sure of his innocence and fully aware of the consequences would dare such a β€difficult and risky adventureβ€, he stated in a letter to the Chief Justice of India in 1999. Not only did Yakub fully cooperate with the Indian agencies, but he even assisted officials in uncovering important details in the conspiracy. But the Chartered Accountant, the most educated in the Memon family, did not anticipate the betrayal that was to follow. Collaborating with the agencies only pulled him closer to the gallows. Yakubβ€™s legal killing will not only take us one step back in the fight against capital punishment, proven to have little impact as a deterrent to crime. There are also many grey areas in his case itself, to argue against the death penalty. For instance, there is still a cloud on the manner of Yakubβ€™s discovery: he claims that he surrendered in Kathmandu; the Central Bureau of Investigation says he was arrested from New Delhi Railway Station. In a revealing article written in 2007 but published just recently, former intelligence boss B. Raman, who coordinated the entire operation, says that Yakub was indeed informally picked up from Nepal before being arrested formally in Delhi. Arguing for Yakub, Mr. Raman, one of the most respected officers the country has had, says he did not believe that Yakub deserved to hang.  The political tinge in hanging Yakubβ€™s involvement in the conspiracy was peripheral, and there is no direct evidence against him. His conviction was based on confessions of the six co-accused, five of whom later retracted. He was charged with financing the blasts, which he claims he did unwittingly. Even as many of his co-accused, including those who actually planted the bombs, got away with lesser charges, or had their death penalties commuted, Yakub will become the first convict to be hanged for the blasts. Why is he the only one? This is not to say that Yakub is totally innocent. He has been convicted by the law and that must be respected, but the death penalty granted to him is not only excessive and disproportionate but reeks of primitive vendetta. It is also a display of regressive action by a frustrated systemβ€™s failure to nab the real culprits. β€Yakub is paying for the sins of his brother. His surname has destroyed him,β€ his wife Rahin Memon said after Yakubβ€™s curative petition was rejected by the Supreme Court. The hanging is also not bereft of a communal and political tinge. The manner in which the Indian state has picked people it wants to hang is revealing. There are several prisoners on the death row in the country, but we see an urgency to hang only Yakub. The Maharashtra government issued an order to hang him even before he exhausted all his legal options of a reprieve. Yakubβ€™s death will further strengthen the perception that the death penalty, often discriminatory, arbitrary, and disproportionate in India, as observed by Amnesty International, is reserved for Muslims, Dalits or the poor. A recent study by the National Law University shows that a mindboggling 94 per cent of people on death row are Muslims or Dalits. As senior journalist Jyoti Punwani wrote, β€Is it just a coincidence that while the majority of those executed since Independence have been Hindus, no murderer motivated by Hindutva has been executed?β€  A travesty of justice That brings us to a larger question of prejudiced justice in India. Yakubβ€™s hanging is being communalised, many say. We cannot expect any public sympathy for Yakub or for any of the accused in the blasts. But if Yakub deserves the gallows, then why shouldnβ€™t Maya Kodnani, a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator, and Babu Bajrangi not follow suit for their conviction for killing 97 Muslims in Ahmebadad in 2002? Doesnβ€™t the β€collective conscienceβ€ crave for justice for the State-sponsored slaughter of innocent Indians in Gujarat? And what about the quench for retribution for the spilling of blood on Mumbaiβ€™s streets in the riots? Politicians, including Shiv Sena and BJP leaders, and senior officers, who were duty-bound to protect lives, were indicted by two independent panels, including the Sri Krishna Commission, for instigating and executing the riots. Unlike the 1993 blast conspirators who escaped to foreign land, the accused in the Babri demolition, often touted as the β€original sin,β€™ and the 1993 riots, live safe in India, many as elected representatives. Many of the indicted officers have been promoted since. If this isnβ€™t a travesty of justice, what is? Now compare the fate of the accused with those fighting for justice. Be it activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s hounding for her fight for justice in the Gujarat riots or public prosecutor Rohini Salian being pressurised to go soft on Hindutva terrorists, a dangerous trend has developed over the years. It is well-established that politically backed criminals and rioters run scot-free in our country, no matter the degree of their crime. Why were the killers of Rajiv Gandhi and Beant Singh, who have political backing of the Tamil Nadu and Punjab governments, been shown clemency? Yakubβ€™s hanging, Ms. Punwani further says, will also send across the β€ominous messageβ€ that our criminal justice system recognises guilt by association, and that there is no place for reformation. Did the state prove to the court that Yakub had no scope for reformation? Yakub spent two decades in solitary confinement, during which he completed two degrees, Political Science and English. Undoubtedly, terror attacks are the most reprehensible form of violence. But terrorism, communal violence and hate donβ€™t foster in isolation. They are politically and socially driven, manufactured realities that stem from the failure of a fair system. What would have caused a mild-mannered, successful Chartered Accountant from Mumbai to land where he is today? If the Indian state feels that his hanging will send a strong message to terrorists, it is wrong. Killing Yakub wonβ€™t bring justice or closure to the victims of the riots and the blasts. Sparing him wonβ€™t amount to betrayal. It will, in fact, give us a chance to prove that our democracy is mature and progressive, and we choose to fight terrorism through restorative means. That opportunity, however, is lost for now.  omar.rashid@thehindu.co.in
The Gujarat High Court on Monday adjourned to August 4 the final hearing of Zakia Jafriβ€™s appeal against a lower court order upholding the clean chit given by Special Investigation Team (SIT) to then-Chief Minister Narendra Modi and others for their alleged roles in 2002 riots. Justice Sonia Gokani adjourned the hearing after Ms. Jafriβ€™s lawyer S.M. Tirmizi sought more time to study case material. The appeal has been filed by activist Teesta Setalvad and Ms. Jafri, the widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, who was killed during the post-Godhra riots of 2002. The apex court asked the SIT to probe the complaint. The SIT submitted a report to the Supreme Court, and the court asked amicus curie Raju Ramchandran to verify it. Mr. Ramchandran also submitted a report to the Supreme Court. On September 12, 2011, the Supreme Court directed the SIT to submit its final report, along with the entire evidence material collected, to the local magistrateβ€™s court. Subsequently, the magistrateβ€™s court in Ahmedabad, revealing the contents of the report, said that the SIT had given a clean chit to Mr. Modi and others. Ms. Setalvad and Ms. Jafri then filed a protest petition, but magistrate B.J. Ganatra rejected it.
Civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad has said that the country is experiencing an undeclared emergency situation due to the increasing interference of the communal forces such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) into the social and cultural sphere. Addressing a seminar on communalism in contemporary India organised by Patyam Gopalan Study and Research Centre, a Communist Party of India (Marxist)-sponsored organisation, here on Thursday, Ms. Setalvad said that Sangh Parivar is working against the foundation of the Constitution. She also called for district-wise social auditing to ascertain the impacts of various social schemes introduced by the Narendra Modi government. She also said that though the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government had come to power by upholding the ΓΆβ‚¬~Gujarat modelΓΆβ‚¬β„Ά as its base, the recent agitation led by Hardik Patel highlighted the fact that the model has only increased more jobless people in the State. CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan inaugurated the seminar. CPI(M) district secretary P. Jayarajan presided. Congress (S) leader Ramachandran Kadannappalli, P.K. Sreemathi, MP, K.K. Rajesh, MP, and T.V. Rajesh, MLA, were among those present at the function.
"New Delhi: Government has given a temporary relief to social activist Teesta Setalvad's two NGOs, which allegedly violated Foreign Currency Regulation Act, by allowing them more time to reply to its showcause notices. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14.  Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notices nearly a month ago following an on site inspection of their records and books of accounts carried out by Home Ministry officials in April this year. \Even after almost a month, no reply has come from the two NGOs. We have extended the deadline by a fortnight and asked them to reply by mid-July to our showcause notices. If the NGOs do not reply even then, we will have no option but to cancel their FCRA registration,\"" a Home Ministry official said. During the probe under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), Home Ministry officials found that Teesta and her husband were running a magazine \""Communalism Combat\"" as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for 'Educational and Economic' purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as 'Legal Aid' which is covered under purpose 'Social'. Hence, it violated FCRA rules, they contended. \""On review of vouchers of the association, it was found that Sabrang Trust has made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand. \""This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus, the association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,\"" the Home Ministry notice said.  """
New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a case against human rights activist Teesta Setalvad over foreign funding. Teesta has been booked for allegedly taking foreign funds without government's permission. The crime branch of police has attached the accounts of Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and two of their NGOs. The accounts were attached in a case in which she is accused of collecting Rs 1.51 crore for a museum for Gulberg Housing Society riot victims but misusing the money.  Setalvad had in June moved the Gujarat High Court seeking to de-freeze her bank accounts. The accounts were attached in a case in which she is accused of collecting Rs 1.51 crore for a museum for Gulberg Housing Society riot victims but misusing the money. A metropolitan court had in November 2014 rejected the plea to de-freeze the accounts. Setalvad moved the HC but the appeal was filed 90 days after the order, so she is seeking condonation of delay. Setalvad is known for championing the cause of 2002 post-Godhra riot victims in Gujarat.  
After the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a case against activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand for illegally receiving foreign funds, it carried out searches at the activist's residence in Mumbai. The Juhu residence of the activist was raided by the CBI as she and her husband had allegedly received foreign funds by contravening Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Last week, the CBI had filed a case against Setalvad and her husband for allegedly receiving foreign funds without government permission.  Speaking to CNN-IBN, Setalvad said that the CBI team had come to her residence with a search warrant. Last week, the CBI had filed a case against Setalvad for allegedly receiving foreign funds without government permission. The accounts of Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and two of their NGOs were also attached. This came almost a month after the Union Home Ministry directed the agency to probe FCRA violations against Setalvad. The activist has alleged that she is being targeted by the NDA government. Meanwhile, the agency on Tuesday filed a case against businessman Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and Sabrang Communications and Publishing on similar charges.

The leaders hailed Setalvad, saying she had been working courageously to expose the criminal involvement of BJP leaders in the Gujarat riots, in which mostly Muslims were killed, and asserted that they were determined to support her.

New Delhi, Sep 11: The Ministry for Home Affairs has suspended the registration of the Teesta Setalvad run Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act of 2010. As a result of this move the foreign funds to the NGO will be blocked. The NGO will not be allowed to receive foreign funds too until the suspension is in force. The notice was issued today by the Ministry for Home Affairs. Earlier similar action was taken against the NGO, Greepeance India as well. The notice was issued under Section 13 of the FCRA. The decision to suspend the registration of the NGO under the FCRA was taken after it was found that the Sabrang Trust had allegedly used foreign funds to the tune of 2,50,000 US dollars for purposes other than it was intended to. Investigations showed that the funds were received by the NGO from the Ford Foundation which is also under the scanner of the Union Home Ministry. It was further alleged by the investigators that the trust used the funds to lobby with media persons in a bid to address communalism and caste based discrimination. However, the NGO was registered to carry out education related work. Earlier the Sabrang trust had told the MHA that the charges were baseless. Teesta had claimed that the probe is politically motivated and the same had been initiated because she had challenged the government in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister.

dna Research & Archives Cracking the whip again on activist Teesta Setalvad, the union home ministry on Thursday suspended theΒ FCRA account of Sabrang Trust for 180 days finding it guilty of 10 violations. The move could well pave the way for termination of Sabrang Trustβ€™s FCRA licence that allows it receive and utilise foreign aid. The Sabrang Trust run by Teesta Seetalvad and her husband Javed Anand, can make a representation against the order within 30 days. If the reply fails to satisfy the Centre, Sabrang Trustβ€™s registration will be cancelled, the ministry said. Of the other two organisations run by Teesta, Citizens for Justice and Peace, has already been put under prior permission category, while the other Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) is undergoing a CBI probe for allegedly accepting and utilising foreign contribution in violation of the FCRA. Teesta was at the forefront of fighting cases on behalf of post-Godhra riots victims in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister. The ministry said, on inspection of accounts of Sabrang Trust, it was noticed that the Association has received total donation of Rs 48.42 lakh and Rs 49.10 lakh in 2010-11 and 2011-12 respectively out of which they have spent Rs 30.97 lakh and Rs 27.07 lakh which comes to 64.23% and 55.14% respectively, on administrative expenses. As per section 8 (1)(b) of FCRA 2010 requires approval of the Home Ministry before incurring expenses on administrative head exceeding 50% limit. Thus, it is a violation of FCRA, the ministry said. During the course of inspection of books and records of the NGO, the ministry noticed that payments of Rs 50 lakh were made by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL, which seems to have been used for personal gain. On review of vouchers of Sabrang Trust, it has been noticed that the Association has transferred Rs 2.46 lakh from foreign contribution designated account to Sabrang Trust's domestic account without any logical reason. This raises the suspicion of mixing of funds by the Association and it can be treated as non-utilisation of foreign contribution for the purpose for which it was received and mixing of foreign contribution with domestic contribution, which is violation of FCRA, the ministry contended. It is also found that Sabrang Trust has made direct payments of approximately Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit cards belonging to Teesta and Javed Anand respectively as payments. The cards are issued in the name of individuals and the above mentioned payments appear that the foreign contribution has been used for personal gain and not authorised as per FCRA. Sabrang Trust paid Rs 1,174 for purchasing an internal medical policy in favour of Anand for attending a conference in Lahore and Rs 4,227 was paid to Anand for purchasing books and travel expenses for attending the People Union for Civil Liberty meeting. The Home Ministry said that from the payments it appears that foreign contribution has been used for personal gain, thus violating FCRA provisions. The Home Ministry said that during inspection of books and records of the NGO, it was noticed that payments of Rs 50 lakh were made by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL which appears to have been used for personal gain. SCPPL is not registered under FCRA and not entitled to accept foreign contribution by any means.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) order, issued on September 10, 2015, mentioned 10 major violations by Sabrang trust noticed during the inspection, further examined after Teestaβ€™s NGO submitted their reply on June 25. The Home Ministry order with the Express said Sabrang trust had made direct payments of approximate Rs 12 Lakh from a FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of IndiaΒ  as payments for credit cards belonging to Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand respectively. β€The cards are issued in the name of individuals and from the above mentioned payment it appears that foreign contribution has been used for personal gain. This amounts to using the foreign contribution for purposes not authorised as per provisions of FCRA, 2010 and has thus violated Section 8(1)(a) of FCRA,β€ the order stated. The MHA had conducted on-site inspection of records and accounts of the association between April 9 and 11 in the Sabrangβ€™s office in Mumbai and subsequently it had communicated the findings on June 5, 2015. The MHA had pointed out that correspondents, columnists and editors are prohibited from accepting foreign contributions but Teesta and Javed Anand violated the rules as both are also working as directors, co-editors, printers and publishers in a company Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd and had published a magazine called Communalism Combat. Further both had written various articles in newspapers and magazines thoughΒ Β  in such a situation they are completely prohibited to accept foreign contributions. The Ministry further noted that Sabrang Trust received over Rs 48 Lakh and Rs 49 lakh in 2010-11 and 2011-12 respectively out of which they have spent Rs 30 Lakh and Rs 27 Lakh, which comes to 64.23 per cent and 55.14 per centΒ  respectively, on administrative expenses.
Teesta Setalvad is accused of embezzling funds meant for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the arrest of activist couple Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand, accused of embezzling funds meant for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots, by four weeks. The apex court decision came after it failed to form a larger bench to hear their anticipatory bail pleas. Setalvad, Anand and an associate of their NGO, GM Peshimam, have been charged with committing fraud and irregularities pertaining to foreign donations received by Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt. Ltd. under the Foreign Currency Regulation Act.

The Sabrang Trust, run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, can make a representation against the order within 30 days. However, if the Home Ministry is not satisfied with the reply of the NGO, its registration will be cancelled. Another NGO run by Teesta and her husband, Citizens for Justice and Peace, has already been put under prior permission category, thus making it mandatory for the organisation to take permission from the Home Ministry before accepting or utilising any foreign contribution.

Teesta has pursued a number of cases of the Gujarat riots victims when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of the state. She has alleged the cases against her are politically motivated. Β 
New Delhi, Sep 11: The Supreme Court of India has extended the stay on the arrest of Teesta Setalvad and her husband until October 15. The court had on an earlier date stayed her arrest after she had moved the Supreme Court seeking anticipatory bail. Today when the matter came up for further hearing, the Supreme Court ordered that the stay on the arrest would continue until October 15th. This would mean that the police will not be allowed to arrest her in the case relating to alleged misuse of funds until October 15th. Teesta and her husband had moved the Supreme Court after the Gujarat High Court had refused to grant them anticipatory bail. Also read:Β Teesta's NGO set to lose FCRA registration The Gujarat High Court had rejected their plea while observing that Teesta and her husband were not cooperating with the investigating agencies and hence they cannot take shelter under an anticipatory bail. The case against Teesta Setalvad: The Gujarat police had booked Teesta and her husband on charges of breach of trust, cheating for misusing funds. The case was pertaining to the construction of the Museum of Resistance in the Gulbarg society at Ahmedabad. A few persons had complained that in the name of constructing this museum funds had been misappropriated by Teesta and her husband. The complainants also alleged that Teesta had collected funds to build this museum but had ended up misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 1.51 crore. OneIndia News

"NEW DELHI: The government has suspended the FCRA licence of one of activist Teesta Setalvad's NGOs, Sabrang Trust, for six months, issuing an order to that effect on Thursday, citing a host of violations. The step was in the offing for nearly a couple of months after a notice was issued to Sabrang Trust. Home Ministry officials, however, denied any link of the removal of LC Goyal as the Home Secretary with the present decision, clarifying that Goyal had never blocked the file and the Ministry had consciously decided to vet its step thoroughly as Setalvad is bound to challenge the same before the court. A ministry official also rejected suggestions of a government campaign against Setalvad, pointing out that the Home Ministry had allowed another NGO run by her, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), to continue operations under its FCRA license after talking prior permission from government for foreign aid. \The violations in terms of CJP were not as serious as Sabrang Trust and hence the former's licence was not suspended,\"" the ministry official said. MHA had earlier marked a CBI inquiry into the affairs of a company run by Setalvad, Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd, which had accepted foreign aid without holding any FCRA license."""
"The Supreme Court has extended interim protection to activist Teesta Setalvad against arrest by four more weeks in alleged fund embezzlement case. Β  The Bombay High Court on 11 August, 2015, granted anticipatory bail to activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, who are being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for alleged misappropriation of funds received from a foreign institution. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while refusing the CBI's plea seeking custodial interrogation of the two, noted, \Prima facie, I am unable to find any act which would bear a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state or threat to the security, strategic, economic or public interest.\"" Justice BhatkarΒ at that time, rejected CBI's argument that the criminal antecedents of the two activists, who have been highlighting the cause of victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots, need to be gone into before deciding on the anticipatory bail application. \""A citizen may conduct social activities and have a different point of view, which may not be liked by the government. However, in a democratic state, a citizen may have his/her different point of view and the state should protect that different point of view,\"" the court said. \""A dissenting view cannot be termed as against the sovereignty of the state. It may be said that it is against the policy of the state. These are two different things.\"" The court granted anticipatory bail to each of them for Rs20,000, in case of arrest, and directed them to cooperate with the CBI and make themselves available to the probe agency as and when required, until filing of the charge sheet. The special CBI court had, in July, rejected the plea which was challenged in the high court. Justice Bhatkar, while allowing it, took into consideration that the accused were Indians and their probability of absconding was negligible. \""Prima facie, the case is relating to accounts not maintained and unavailable documents. If they are not produced, then a prosecution can be lodged and charges framed, for which custodial interrogation is not required,\"" she said. The CBI had, on July 8, registered a case against Setalvad and Anand, alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) had received around 2.90 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). It is alleged that SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs1.8 crore was, therefore, received in violation of the Act, as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the union home ministry. The activists were not disclosing where they had utilised the funds received. However, the activists, through their counsel Aspi Chenoy, had argued that the funds received were not donations but fees paid towards the services hired by the foreign organisation, Four Foundation. It was informed that income tax was duly deducted and no objection had been raised by the department in 2004 to 2006. With inputs from Mustafa Plumber"""

Anil Dharker Mr Modi must encourage civil society, even when it is out of step with him. This will enhance his international reputation as a true democrat. And as a result, many more Time magazine covers will follow. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyayβ€™s excellent biography of Narendra Modi was written two years ago, so in a sense, it is now dated. But in many ways it is not. First of all, in its writing, the author had access to Mr Modi, an access now denied to all writers and journalists. It is understandable, of course, that the Prime Minister of a country has very little time at his disposal for one-to-one conversations with the media. But, as we all know, Mr Modi has carried this hands-off policy to an extreme, not even giving a single press conference in the year gone by. In keeping with that policy, he is also the first Prime Minister of India to discontinue the practice of taking Indian journalists on the Prime Ministerβ€™s plane on his travels abroad. As we all know, Mr Modi has racked up more travel miles than most foreign ministers, so several opportunities for inter-action with the media were lost. Or rather, deliberately dismissed. It is significant that the only interview he has given is the one very recently to the Time magazine. This confirms two things: our Prime Minister has decided that by being overseas and making himself accessible to world media, he develops an international image which he then hopes will percolate down to his own country. As a corollary to this, we can add that Mr Modi has a deep distrust of Indian media. In this context, one passage in Mukhopadhyayβ€™s book is significant. Speaking indirectly of the 2002 communal carnage in Gujarat and the religious divide between Hindus and Muslims that this represented, Mr Modi says, β€There is one conspiratorial group which keeps this emotional hurt alive by digging up the wounds. When that group stops its work, the wounds will get automatically healed.β€ That one passage says so very many revealing things about our Prime Minister, the most significant being his belief that if only things were left alone, we could all forget about what happened, and everyone would be happy again. Overlooked is the fact that this β€conspiratorial groupβ€ has been fighting a lone battle to bring those guilty of mass murder to justice, and had it not been for this β€conspiratorialβ€ group, 126 people, including a Gujarat Cabinet minister, would not have gone to jail to serve long sentences. Itβ€™s hardly a secret that this group is the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) of which Teesta Setalvad and Javed Anand are the main activists, and for the last one year they have been hounded by allegations of β€misappropriationβ€ and have had their bank accounts frozen, this almost completely paralysing their work. The use of the word β€conspiratorialβ€ also tells its own tale, and shows us why the operations of Greenpeace and the Ford Foundation, amongst others, have come under the baleful gaze of the government. Greenpeace has been an irritant to many countries, not just India, but in spite of its exaggerations, and occasional disruptive methods, its motives worldwide are the same, which is to protect the environment. The Ford Foundation, on the other hand, has a well-earned reputation for funding worthwhile projects throughout the world. For it to come under the radar of the government, is puzzling, to say the least. But Mr Modiβ€™s suspicion of NGOs is obviously deep rooted: if you remember it was just over a month ago, addressing a meeting of high court judges he made that odd statement warning the judiciary not to be swayed by β€five-star activistsβ€. To this day, it is not clear what, or who, he meant. Did he mean five-star, as in movie ratings, where five stars is best, or did he mean members of the NGOs who stay in five-star hotels? It doesnβ€™t really matter; what matters is the animus that statement contains. (To be fair to Mr Modi, he is not alone in this. The United Progressive Alliance government, particularly Kapil Sibal, had started turning the screws on NGOs; itβ€™s just that the Bharatiya Janata Party government has brought matters to a head). There are two sides to this, as there are to most things. There exist a very large number of useless to fraudulent NGOs. In fact, in Delhi, the story is that many NGOs belong to the wives or children of senior bureaucrats. That way the bureaucrats donβ€™t actually have to receive a bribe. Give a donation to my wifeβ€™s NGO, they will say. Many other NGOs may not have relatives in high places, but they also receive donations for which they do no work. On the other side, there are very many NGOs doing the kind of development work which the government really should be doing, but its efforts get mired in corruption so that state money allocated for good works never gets to the intended recipients. How many organisations work selflessly, and for hardly any monetary reward in the fields of basic education, health and nutrition, womenβ€™s welfare and rights, and other such fields? Very many, and without them, our country would be a poorer place, and those suffering deprivation would be further deprived. Governments, both at the state and Central level should see these NGOs as their allies and not as their adversaries. They should see that their work complements governmentβ€™s welfare measures, and this ultimately brings goodwill to the government in power. One suspects however, that the government β€” any government β€” is concerned more with the β€politicalβ€ and social agenda of some NGOs because it conflicts with the agenda of the ruling establishment. This is where a true democrat stands up and says, β€So what? This dissent, or contrarian point of view, only strengthens democracy.β€ If, for example, CJP brings criminals to justice, does it not strengthen our judicial system, and give people the message that wrong-doing will always be punished? This may not suit the government in power, but it is of immense benefit to the country, and to so many of our important institutions. So, astute politician that he is, Mr Modi must encourage civil society, even when it is out of step with him. This will only enhance his international reputation as a true democrat. And as a result, many more Time magazine covers will follow. The writer is a senior journalist Β  Tweet
Jitender Tomarβ€™s arrest took place when the Supreme Court recently protected social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband from arrest by Gujarat Police in the Gulbarg embezzlement case. A Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra granted the couple anticipatory bail. Noting that their β€personal liberty should not be put on the ventilator in an ICUβ€, Justice Misra had said there was no need for any personal interrogation because the case was based on documents, which can be provided by Ms. Setalvad to the police. β€At most, this is basically a mismanagement of accounts. What is the need for custodial interrogation? This is not a case in which personal liberty should be taken away,β€ Justice Misra told Gujarat counsel and senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani. In the recent case of off-loading of a Greenpeace activist, the Delhi High Court had held that the expression β€personal libertyβ€ under Article 21 has wide amplitude. In the Joginder Kumar versus State of Uttar Pradesh judgment of 1994, the Supreme Court had held that β€indiscriminate arrestsβ€ is a violation of human rights. Arrest can be made only after the police are satisfied of its necessity and justification. The act of arresting should β€properly balance individual rights and liberties with societyβ€™s rightsβ€.
The Delhi Police has gone by the rule book to arrest State Law Minister Jitender Singh Tomar on Monday for faking his certificates, but the sudden nature of the arrest in the backdrop of an ongoing power tussle between the Centre and Delhi government, raises doubts if the case required the Minister to be deprived of his personal liberty. Again, experts ask whether custodial interrogation was necessary in a case entirely based on documentary evidence. Arrests without warrants, as was done in the case of Mr. Tomar, can be made under Section 41 of the CrPC on the basis of a reasonable complaint or credible information or if a reasonable suspicion exists. In fact, a 2010 amendment to Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the police to record the reason in writing in case they choose not to arrest a person. The Delhi Police maintain that they have not broken any procedure in the arrest of the minister. Experts confirm too. β€There is nothing preventing the police from arresting any person, including a sitting minister, for custodial interrogation, especially if the offence against him is forgery and fabrication of documents. In fact, if they had not arrested him, the police would have been in the dock because the 2010 amendment to the CrPC requires the police to give reasons in writing for not arresting,β€ Justice K.T. Thomas, retired Supreme Court judge, said. However, the nature, intent and manner of the arrest have left serious doubts in the minds of several legal experts. Former Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran wondered whether the arrest was an instance of β€pre-trial convictionβ€. Besides experts ask why there was need for an arrest if the entire material evidence in the case is documentary. This arrest has happened when the Supreme Court had recently protected social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband from arrest by the Gujarat Police in the Gulbarg embezzlement case. A bench led by Justice Dipak Misra granted the couple anticipatory bail. Noting that their β€personal liberty should not be put in the ventilator in an ICUβ€, Justice Misra said there was no need for any personal interrogation because the case is based on documents, which can be provided by the Ms. Setalvad to the police. In the Joginder Kumar versus State of Uttar Pradesh judgment of 1994, the Supreme Court has held that β€indiscriminate arrestsβ€ are a violation of human rights. Arrest can be made only after the police is satisfied of its necessity and justification.

Home Ministry notice alleges violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act; Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace asked to reply within 15 days.Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notices by the Union Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and asked to reply within 15 days. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Ms. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notice two days ago following an on-site inspection of records and books of accounts carried out by the Ministry officials in April 2015. During the probe, sources said, it was found that they were running a magazine Communalism Combat as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under the FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. The CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs. 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs. 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for β€educational and economicβ€ purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as β€legal aidβ€, which is covered under purpose β€socialβ€. Hence, it violated the provisions of the FCRA rules, the sources contended. β€On review of vouchers of the association it was found that Sabrang Trust have made payment of Rs. 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand. β€This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,β€ the Home Ministry notice said. The Home Ministry investigation also found that Mr. Anand has taken international medical policy for visiting Lahore and debited the amount in the account of Sabrang Trust. Further, even book purchases and travel expenses incurred by him to attend meetings with the Peopleβ€™s Union For Civil Liberties were debited in Sabrang Trust allegedly in violation of Section 8(1)(a) of FCRA. The Home Ministryβ€™s inspection has also found that an amount of Rs. 50 lakh was allegedly transferred by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL which is not registered under FCRA. FCRA rules prohibit transfer of foreign contribution to any non-FCRA account unless such entity is also registered and had been granted the certificate or obtained prior permission under this Act. The investigation also found various alleged irregularities like administrative expenditure exceeding more than 50 per cent. Besides, different figures towards expenses incurred on legal aid in the books of accounts and in the receipts of payment accounts, closing balance of the proceeding year was allegedly not reported as opening balance and even the funds received from United Nations not found in the bank statement, the sources claimed.
June 25, 1934 has got a curious connection to the three shots fired at around 5:10 pm on the fateful Friday of January 30, 1948, shots that would go on to silence the life of a 79-year-old frail but resolute Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. For it was on that day, while on a visit to Pune, that Gandhiji witnessed the first of six attempts on his life, the sixth of which was to result in his death. That two of the four subsequent unsuccessful attempts were to involve his eventual assassin, Nathuram Godse, did not force law enforcement authorities to keep an eye on the misguided Hindu fanatic. The act of murder of an individual to whom poet Rabindranath Tagore gave the moniker β€Mahatmaβ€™, one who Subhash Chandra Bose referred to as β€Father of the Nationβ€™, has rightly been called by Teesta Setalvad in this dossier as the first act of terror committed in independent India. For what was it if not the result of an organised conspiracy on the part of a section of people to spread terror among Indian public at large? Setalvad, the curator of this collection of articles, documents and excerpts from books on the assassination, says the bookβ€™s aim is to collect and preserve the archival truths associated with the Mahatmaβ€™s murder, documents that she feels are under threat of cleansing under the present dispensation. The murder, she says, was β€a declaration of war and a statement of intent.β€ Declaration of war by a section of society which remained largely on the fringes during the independence struggle. This was a section that bore visceral dislike toward the idea of composite culture and inclusive nationhood advocated by the Mahatma. However, subsequent events, the most seminal of which was the adoption of an intellectual masterpiece in the form of the Indian Constitution on January 26, 1950, make it clear that the assassination failed on both counts. The Fundamental Rights and Economic Principles, which first found mention in the Karachi Resolution of 1931 and to which this book refers to as the antithesis of all that the Hindu Right stood for, were incorporated and, later, institutionalised by the three pillars of our democracy. It was Magna Carta more than Manusmriti that guided the way we govern our political life. However, as indicated in different sections of this book, the majoritarian ideology that led to Gandhijiβ€™s killing and communal violence in independent India continued to flourish under the patronage of fringe organisations. A considerable portion of the book reproduces archival files, and documents. However, the parts in which it is at its most impressive are the places where the lucidity of literature trumps the monotony of journalism. For instance, the essay β€The Last Hours of the Mahatmaβ€™ by Stephen Murphy, where it is indicated that the Mahatma had a foreboding on that Friday morning that he wonβ€™t live for long. Or the compassionate editorials published by Pakistani newspapers which paid poignant tributes to the Mahatma, which prove that his ideas did have their admirers in Indiaβ€™s conjoined twin toward the west in its initial days. One of them that appeared in Pakistan Times compared his killing to the crucifixion of Christ. Another one, by poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz, calling Gandhiji β€a symbol of hope and courageβ€ to Muslims, said his death was a loss to both countries. The most important piece here is the English translation of Jagan Phadnisβ€™s book Mahatmyachi Akher (End of the Sage) on which the strength of Setalvadβ€™s collection rests. Phadnis stresses that the murder was a failed attempt to silence the soul of someone who, in life and death, championed right to equality and dignity of the masses, someone whose thinking shaped the very idea of an independent India. Pankaj Mishra, in his biography of Buddha, compared the philosophy of Gautama to that propagated by Gandhi β€” the belief that a change in attitude can be brought about by appealing to oneβ€™s conscience. Gandhiji believed that in practising non-violence, oneβ€™s sympathies should be expressed toward the oppressor as well as the victim, to the point where the oppressor undergoes a change of heart. His death, however, failed to bring about a change of heart in his assassins. Be it Nathuram or his brother and co-conspirator Gopal Godse, whose interview in 1994 to Arvind Rajagopal is reproduced in this book, they remained unrepentant till the end. However, had he survived on that Friday, Gandhiji β€” having forgiven Godse for one of the previous attempts on his life β€” would have chosen not to consider him an adversary. This book holds the Hindu Right guilty of propagating the majoritarian idea of Hindu Rashtra. However, the mainstreaming of the kind of inclusive politics that the Mahatma visualised made sure that such impulses, which in due course became de rigeur in Pakistan, were kept in check. The kind of admiration the Mahatma invokes in different sections of not just our society but also that of other nations, in contrast to the revulsion his antitheses provoke, proves that moderation triumphs over vituperation in the long run.
"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday extended by four weeks the anticipatory bail granted to activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a case related to alleged misuse of funds meant for Gujarat riots victims. A bench of Justices A R Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the interim protection from arrest, granted earlier by the apex court, will continue till October 15. As the interim protection was set to expire on September 15, Teesta's counsel Kapil Sibal and Aparna Bhatt brought up the issue before the presiding bench requesting an extension. The couple had moved the apex court after the Gujarat high court denied them anticipatory bail in the case. While staying the order of the state court, the Supreme Court had on March 19 referred it to a larger bench saying the issue required a harmonious construction between regulated freedom and non-cooperation of accused in investigations. Setalvad and her husband have been booked by the crime branch of Gujarat police on charges of cheating, breach of trust and under the IT Act, in a matter relating to the construction of the \Museum of Resistance\"" in Gulbarg Society, Ahmedabad, which was hit by riots in 2002.

KOCHI: β€Communal forces are underplaying great leaders of history if not eliminating them and are trying toΒ  appropriate social reformers like Sree Narayana Guru and Ambedkarβ€, said activist Teesta Setalvad. β€Those forces hide certain part of history from our youth. We need to ask what kind of future generation we want or what thinking process we need,β€ she said. Teesta was delivering the keynote address in the seminar organised by the T K Ramakrishnan Cultural Centre on β€Threat of Communalism in Secular Keralaβ€™ here on Friday. β€Now there is a quick shift in identity-based crisis. The Gujarat model of development, which is a jobless model, is being implemented at the national level as well. β€The best alternative- the Kerala model -has to be projected in counter to that,β€ said the activist. It was on Thursday that The Ministry of Home Affairs suspended the registration of theΒ  activistβ€™s Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010. β€Those who have nothing to do with Indiaβ€™s independence struggle is now trying to judge who is better Hindu or who is worst Muslim? We have to fight with two forces; one, hardcore rightist policies and the other, hard core fundamentalist thoughts. β€Today we canβ€™t talk about communal forces without thinking of economic right wing policies. It is not possible to counter communal forces unless we defeat neo-liberal policies,β€ she said. She alleged that the BJP government was trying to sabotage various pro-poor laws and schemes implemented by previous governments like the Right to Education Act, Food Safety Act and Amendment to the Land Acquisition Bill. β€The electronic media is owned by corporates and last election there was a media campaign for one individual to become the Prime Minister. There is a cultural and structural change taking place before our eyes . The middle class has lost its empathy and concern towards the wider section,β€ the activist said. β€stand with us, fight communalismβ€™ As the fight between the CPM and the SNDP Yogam continues over the portrayal of Sree Narayana Guru, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan urged the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam to stand with the party in the fight against communal forces. He blamed that the BJP is trying to distort the ideologies and principles of Sree Narayana Guru. He criticised the RSS for β€carrying out its fundamentalist agenda by owning great personalities of history and forΒ  for trying to create fundamental polarisation in Kerala by joining hands with community based organisations.β€ Kodiyeri was inaugurating the seminar organised by T K Ramakrishnan Cultural Centre on β€Threat of Communalism in Secular Keralaβ€™ here on Friday.

 New Delhi:Β  In fresh trouble for social activist Teesta Setalvad, government today asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. In a parallel move, government froze the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). SCPPL had received foreign donation of USD 2,90,000 and Rs 1.30 crore in β€contraventionβ€ of FCRA and without getting clearance of the Home Ministry, said the Ministryβ€™s letter to CBI said while ordering a probe. According to rules, a private firm can accept donations from overseas only if it is registered under FCRA. The Ministry also asked IDBI Bank to freeze an account of the firm and not to allow further credit and withdrawal of foreign contribution without its permission, it said. A number of violations of rules and discrepancies were noticed by Home Ministry officials who had conducted an inspection between June 8-10 of the accounts and records of the firm for the period 2006-07 to 2014-15 at its Mumbai office. Efforts to contact Setalvad for her comments failed. She did not reply to SMS sent to her mobile. However, earlier she had said in a statement that Sabrang Trust had co-operated with the ministryβ€™s inspection team. SCPPL was not permitted to receive foreign contribution under any circumstances. It had also not applied for β€prior permissionβ€ before accepting the foreign grant, the letter said. β€As per project module submitted by the foreign donor, it is mentioned that Sabrang as part of its public campaign would lobby with government in the public sphere to deepen and broaden the concept of minority or minorities. It is stated that lobbying with political parties is not allowed as per provision of FCRA, 2010,β€ the ministry said quoting the findings of the inspection. The firm also mixed its foreign contribution with their domestic donation in β€violationβ€ of the Act. It also did not maintain exclusive bank account for receipt of foreign fund, the letter said. The inspection findings cited an agreement between the firm and Ford Foundation which restricted the use of funds for β€charitable, scientific literacy or educational purposeβ€ but the firm could not be treated as grant provided for the purpose of rendering any service, it said. SCPPL is also prohibited to receive foreign fund as it is publishing monthly periodicals and two of its directors have been writing columns and articles in newspapers, it said. CBI has been asked to conduct an investigation into the matter β€considering the gravity and complexity of the caseβ€. Β  The investigation report may be submitted to the Ministry at earliest, the letter said. CBI has also been asked to submit status and progress reports in the matter on quarterly basis. Β  Todayβ€™s action comes after a request from Gujarat government to the Home Ministry seeking action against Ford Foundation. It had alleged that the US-based organisation was β€interfering in internal affairsβ€ of the country and also β€abetting communal disharmonyβ€ through an NGO run by Setalvad. Β  The fund transfer from Ford Foundation has, at present, to be cleared by a nodal official in the Home Ministry. In April, the government had ordered that funds from Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry. Β  Gujarat government and Setalvad are embroiled in legal battles. While she has filed several cases against the state government functionaries, including the then chief minister Narendra Modi in connection with post-Godhra riots of 2002.Β  Gujarat police have filed a case of alleged embezzlement of funds against her.

 Ahmedabad:Β  Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs - Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. Β  The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch last year, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society to 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Β  Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10. Β  They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case. One of the residents of Gulbarg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan had filed a complaint against Setalwad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulbarg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but it had not been utilised for the purpose. Β  On January 5 last year, an FIR was lodged under IPC Section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, Section 406 (fraud) and Section 420 (cheating) against Setalwad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, chairman of Gulberg society Salim Sandhi and secretary of the society Feroz Gulzar for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore. Β  Yesterday, the Centre had asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by her private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. Government had also frozen the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). On 28 February, 2002, after the Godhra train carnage, 69 people including Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society here during the riots.

"New Delhi: The apex court's Bar on Wednesday strongly backed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) and sharply attacked the collegium system which produced judges who give relief to film stars and politicians while the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the 2002 Gujarat riots have not got justice. Referring to cases related to these two riots, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President and senior advocate Dushyant Dave told a five-judge bench headed by Justice J S Khehar that common man and the victims of violations of human rights have not been given justice. Referring to cases related to these two riots, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President and senior advocate Dushyant Dave told a five-judge bench headed by Justice J S Khehar that common man and the victims of violations of human rights have not been given justice.  \It's a shame on us that we have not delivered justice to cases related to violations of human values and human rights,\"" the bench, also comprising justices J Chelameswar, M B Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel said. At one stage during arguments, he said persons like Maya Kodnani, a former Guajarat minister convicted in a riots case, are getting relief on the one hand and on the other, activist Teesta Setalvad had to run from pillar to post to get anticipatory bail, he said. The Bar leader gave several recent instances without naming the persons where a convicted politician and two Bollywood stars got relief from the Supreme Court and two different High Courts respectively. \""Why film stars and politicians get instant relief from courts and the common man suffers for years,\"" Dave raised a question and answered himself,\""It is because of bad judges.\"" Dave asked the judges to \""wear burqa\"" and walk on court's corridor to have a first-hand account of the status of the judicial system. \""You cannot have ideal humans across the board,\"" the bench said and asked the SCBA president to suggest remedial measures to better the system. \""You have given us enough 'lecture'. Why don't you give suggestions to improve. You must give a remedial situation. You just want to react but don't want to suggest anything. Dave was upset at the word \""lecture\"" used by the bench and said that he spoke from the heart and did not intend to hurt the sentiments of the judiciary. \""I felt hurt as my Lord characterised my argument as lecture. What I spoke came from my heart. I still say majority of judges are outstanding and a minority is bad,\"" Dave said. \""There are many things spoken from heart. You paint all of the judges with the same brush. We understand the agony and spirit but we want remedy. You can think over it and tell us,\"" the bench said. At the outset, Dave referred to various Constitutional provisions related to appointment of judges in trial courts and higher judiciary and said that constitutional framers have rejected the primacy of judiciary after debating the issue in the Constituent Assembly. The 1993 judgement turned the Constitutional scheme \""upside down\"", he said adding \""how can your Lordship read into words which were not there at all...the Constitution cannot be tinkered with in this fashion. \""You cannot add a word in a Constitution which was not there and it is not that the issue was not debated in the Constituent Assembly. It was debated and rejected\"". Finding fault with the 1993 verdict that had paved the way for the collegium system, he said,\""I dare say that the judgement did not refer to any Constituent Assembly debate and previous judgements\"". On the issue of nomination of two eminent persons in the NJAC, Dave said that the executive, the Parliament and the judiciary are well represented in the panel which would select them. \""What more can be there to ensure that the process is safeguarded,\"" he said adding that the objections raised by petitioners including Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAORA) are mere \""apprehensions\"". \""There is every reason to believe that two eminent persons would be nominated by an unanimous choice,\"" he said and added that even the court can say that there has to be collective decision. During the hearing, Dave referred to various incidents to highlight the shortcomings of the collegium system. A Bollywood actor has been granted relief by the Gujarat High Court where a bench was constituted for it, he said adding \""the Supreme Court grants bail to in one day to a convicted politician\"". \""In fact, every court is going extra mile to protect the high and mighty... a driver gets bail within hours if he happens to be film star,\"" he said adding that it doesn't happen for the common man. He then referred to appointment of a High Court judge who was the partner of a son of a former Chief Justice of India and said that the Chief Justice of the High Court was later rewarded with his elevation to the apex court. He also gave the illustration of a Kolkata High Court judge who had objected to the appointment of the sister of the ex-CJI in the High Court judiciary. \""There is no smoke without fire\"", he said adding \""wear a burqa and walk in the corridor, you will be embarrasse  """
New Delhi: Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notice by Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and asked to reply within 15 days. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notice following an on-site inspection of records and books of accounts carried out by Home Ministry officials in April this year. Sources said during the probe it was found that they were running a magazine Communalism Combat as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contributions. MHA has served notices, to be answered within 15 days, to 2 NGO's run by activist Teesta Setalvad under FCRA regulations. The NGO's registered for 'educational and economic' purposes spent Rs. 95 lakhs on legal aid or 'social' purpose, vioating FCRA.  Under the FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to the notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for 'Educational and Economic' purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as 'Legal Aid' which is covered under purpose 'Social'. Hence, it violated the provisions of the FCRA rules, they contended.  
"New Delhi: Government, on Friday, ordered a CBI into transfer of funds by US-based Ford Foundation to Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL), with which social activist Teesta Stelvad is associated, allegedly in violation of rules and froze a bank account of the firm. Sources said SCPPL was allegedly in violation of rules of Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) in accepting a donation of $ 2.9 lakh from Ford Foundation without getting clearance of the Home Ministry. Government ordered a CBI probe into transfer of funds by Ford Foundation to SCPPL, a firm with which social activist Teesta Setalvad is associated, on the grounds of FCRA violations.  According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it is registered under FCRA. This donation was, therefore, a \serious violation\"" of FCRA provisions which mandate funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration, the sources said. A bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, has been frozen at the instruction of the Home Ministry, the sources said. Gujarat government had asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was \""interfering in internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by Setalvad. The fund transfer from Ford Foundation has, at present, to be cleared by a nodal official in the Home Ministry. In April, the government had ordered that funds from Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the Home Ministry. Gujarat government and Setalvad are embroiled in legal battles. While she has filed several cases against the state government functionaries, including the then chief minister Narendra Modi in connection with post Godhra riots of 2002, the state police have filed a case of alleged embezzlement of funds against her. Setalvad had, in her statement earlier, said that Sabrang Trust had co-operated with a Home Ministry team which visited its offices.  """
Ahmedabad: Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs - Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch on 2014, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society to 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10.  Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case. One of the residents of Gulbarg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan had filed a complaint against Setalwad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulbarg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but it had not been utilised for the purpose. On January 5 ,2014, an FIR was lodged under IPC Section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, Section 406 (fraud) and Section 420 (cheating) against Setalwad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, chairman of Gulberg society Salim Sandhi and secretary of the society Feroz Gulzar for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore. On Friday, the Centre had asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by her private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. Government had also frozen the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). On 28 February, 2002, after the Godhra train carnage, 69 people including Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society Ahmedabad during the riots.  
 New Delhi: The Supreme Court today extended by four weeks the interim protection from arrest granted to Teesta Setalvad and her husband in a case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabad's Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. A bench comprising Justices A R Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the interim protection from arrest will continue till October 15. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the issue on behalf of the couple, saying the interim order was expiring on September 15. Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have challenged the order of the Gujarat High Court denying them anticipatory bail in the case. The High Court order was stayed by the apex court and has been pending to be heard by a three-judge bench. The apex court had on April 16 constituted a three-judge bench to hear afresh the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband as a two-judge bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Kumar Goel on March 19 had referred it to a larger bench and extended its interim order protecting them against arrest till the larger bench takes up the matter. The couple have denied all charges levelled by the Gujarat Police, which in an affidavit in July had alleged that they had misappropriated funds meant for charity for personal expenses buying items ranging from wine to mobile phone, besides tampering with evidence. Teesta and her husband, who have been fighting for justice for the victims of the riots, have denied all allegations contending that they have been implicated in the case and were victims of political vendetta.

READ: US Ambassador Richard Verma warns of 'chilling effect' of crackdown on NGOs As mentioned in an Indian Express report, Rijiju said that there is no witch-hunt against NGOs and there were laxities on part of the previous government in implementation of laws due to which the NGOs were safe until now. In the last few months, the Home Ministry cancelled the Foreign Contribution Regulatory Authority (FCRA) registration of Greenpeace, and put 16 foreign donors including Ford Foundation on its watchlist and cancelled the registration of 8975 NGOs for violation of norms.

" New Delhi: The Union Home Ministry is bracing itself for strict action against Teesta Setalvad's Sabrang Trust for receiving funds from Ford Foundation and diverting it to Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited which does not have a FCRA registration. Ford Foundation, donor of Setalvad's NGO has already been put under home ministry's watchlist for violating Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Sabrang Trust which received a $2.9 lakh grant from Ford Foundation may be asked to seek prior permission for funding from all its foreign sources, or even face suspension of its FCRA registration. According to a Times of India report, home ministry is still debating over the nature of the action that is to be taken against Sabrang Trust for violating FCRA provisions by utilizing funds for purposes other than that permitted by the donor. The report quoted a senior home ministry official saying that the Gujarat government's accusations against the NGO of \direct interference ... in the internal affairs of the country and also abetting communal disharmony in India\"" were serious enough to consider suspension of its FCRA certificate. The government may invoke the rarely-used Section 11(3) (iv) of the FCRA, 2010, mandating prior clearance of its funding, irrespective of the foreign source. The MHA had inspected the accounts of Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice & Peace after Gujarat government wrote to it alleging \""serious\"" FCRA violations by the two NGOs. These include utilization of over 50% of foreign contribution from Ford Foundation for office expenses. In a related matter, thirty-three MPs have written to Home Minister Rajnath Singh, saying the \""selective targeting\"" of persons should end. The signatories to the petition, including Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Mohd Salim, Ram Gopal Yadav and K C Tyagi, said targeting of Setalvad is a \""vindicative attempt\"" to silence the voice of justice for the Gujarat riot victims.

US-based Ford Foundation has funded a political party and profit making organisations β€illegallyβ€ which has resulted in the foreign outfit coming under the Home Ministry scanner and put on the β€watch listβ€. A senior Home Ministry official said an investigation has found that funds sanctioned by the Ford Foundation to an NGO have reached a political party which automatically makes the donor liable to face action. But the Ford Foundation has rejected the charge. The probe has also found that Ford Foundation has funded several organisations which do not fall in the category of NGOs, which are eligible for receiving foreign funds, as they make profits, the official said. The international donor strongly refuted the charge of funding political parties but accepted that it worked with various entities including those which work for profits. β€We wish to affirm that the foundation does not fund political parties. The foundation does, however, work with a range of other entities, including non-governmental organisations, government and quasi-government entities, universities, and for-profit entities, depending on the needs of the particular work involved. β€This includes engaging for-profit entities to provide services to the foundation and its grantee communities,β€ Ford Foundation spokesperson Joshua Cinelli told PTI in a statement. Under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, no donor can fund political parties or any organisation which makes profits. Following the investigation, the Home Ministry has put the Ford Foundation on its β€watch listβ€ and ordered that all funds coming from the US-based donor have to be routed only with its nod due to β€national security concernsβ€. The Reserve Bank of India has been requested to instruct all the banks and their branches to ensure that any fund flow from Ford Foundation to any person, NGO or organisation in India should be brought to the notice of the Home Ministry so that funds are allowed to be credited into the accounts of the recipient only after clearance of the Ministry. The Home Ministry has also found that Ford Foundation has given funds to at least six NGOs which were not registered under the FCRA, making the payment β€illegalβ€, the official said. The Ford Foundation said it would continue to respond fully to official queries directed to it but was yet to hear directly from the Home Ministry. β€Our aim is to work closely with government partners to clarify any area of question or concern. If the Government suggests methods by which we can strengthen and improve our grant-making processes, we will take swift and appropriate steps to incorporate them. β€We are confident in our work and compliance with law and look forward to a constructive outcome. Most importantly, we appreciate the privilege of supporting the people of India and look forward to continuing to do so,β€ Ford Foundation said. Interestingly, Gujarat government had recently asked the Home Ministry to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was β€interfering in internal affairsβ€ of the country and also β€abetting communal disharmonyβ€ through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. The action against Ford Foundation came weeks after the Home Ministry froze seven bank accounts of Greenpeace India and barred it from receiving foreign funds for allegedly violating FCRA and β€prejudiciallyβ€ affecting the countryβ€™s public and economic interests.
Civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad noted that a splintered opposition had allowed a proto-fascist government to come to power at the Centre. Ms. Setelvad said it was time for all democratic forces, including Leftists, Dalits and Gandhians in the country, to join forces to combat the communal hatred being spread by RSS elements. β€We need a strong Left at this juncture. Introspection on all sides is very important,β€ she said speaking at the β€Meet the Mediaβ€™ programme here on Thursday, jointly organised by Telangana Working Journalistsβ€™ Federation, A.P. Working Journalistsβ€™ Federation and Hyderabad Union of Journalists. The Opposition is a divided lot and this had resulted in BJP securing 59 of the 75 reserved seats in the Lok Sabha, apart from Lok Janshakti Partyβ€™s five seats, Ms. Setalvad pointed out. She wondered if the Dalit movement was examining what this phenomenon meant. Attributing the cases slapped against her to the smear campaign by Sangh Parivar forces, she said so far, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) had provided over 20,000 documents to the Crime Branch of Gujarat Police investigating the case, while the State had failed to charge-sheet her or provide incriminating evidence. So far, a total of 68 cases have been filed against her and CJP in relation to the Gujarat massacre of 2002, of which 22 are pending. She personally is facing eight criminal cases. There have been multiple attempts by the Gujarat Police to arrest her in the past. Making it clear that she would not be intimidated by efforts to silence her, Ms. Setalvad said she and her colleagues would face even jail. β€Sections of the Gujarat Police are showing undue interest in going after individuals supporting the survivors of the mass murder incident, and we see a pattern and a motive behind it. Unfortunately, in our country, it is a perpetrator government ruling at the Centre. If they would have their way, they would like to see us in custody. If that is the fate which awaits us, we shall face that. We are not running away. People struggling for Indiaβ€™s freedom were sent to jail. We will go to jail,β€ she affirmed.

The Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), a forum for promoting democratic unity among artists, has issued a statement in support of the FTII students who are on an indefinite hunger strike protesting the controversial appointment of BJP leader Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairman. Here's the full text of the statement and list of signatories: As the strike by students of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) enters its fourth month, and the condition of students on hunger strike deteriorating alarmingly, we join the distinguished alumni of the institute, national award winning film personalities and others of the artistic fraternity, in extending our solidarity to the cause they are fighting for. We are shocked and outraged at the continuing intransigence of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting which has refused to give the agitating students a fair hearing. Cynical indifference to the need for top quality management in a premier national institution sparked the student strike. And in the manner that the Ministry and its top officials β€“ including the Union Minister and the Minister of State β€“ have allowed the strike to drag on, a clear tendency is evident to put political prestige before institutional integrity. We are deeply disturbed over the possibility of a national asset, an institution set up with ambitions of creative excellence, being irreparably damaged.We underline once again that national institutions are not to be transformed into parking lots for second-rate talents and political time-servers. The pattern of appointing individuals who have nothing to recommend them except their engagement in campaign propaganda for the ruling party is too shockingly obvious to ignore. Some of Indiaβ€™s most distinguished film personalities, all recipients of national and international honours, have appealed to the President to intervene and advise the government to take heed of the dangers of prolonged default on its responsibilities. We join this appeal since every other recourse has seemingly been exhausted.

KOCHI: In recent times, the State has witnessed women activists successfully spearheading various agitations, with the protest launched by tea plantation workers in Munnar being the latest one. The new trend began with β€Penkoottuβ€™, which made the voice of women employees heard in 2009 through their fight for toilet facility for women in workplaces. Encouraged by the positive response to the agitation, β€Penkoottuβ€™ later formed the Asanghatitha Meghala Thozhilali Union (AMTU) to fight for the right to β€sit during workβ€™, and other demands like fair wage and regulation of working hours. In May 2014, salesgirls at a textile showroom in Kozhikode staged an β€Irikkal Samaramβ€™, which echoed in textiles showrooms in Thrissur in 2014 and in Alappuzha in August 2015. The initial protest made the government amend the Shops and Commercial Establishments Act - 1960. However, the Alappuzha strike indicated that provisions of the Act were not properly implemented. Β  β€In future, it will be women who take up social issues also. Women are forced to come out in the open after being suppressed for many years - at home, workplace and in society at large,β€ said ATMU leader P Viji. Β  C K JanuΒ  who led the Muthanga agitation and the β€Nilpu Samaramβ€™ has been persistent in her fight for the welfare of tribal people. Both the protests were marked byΒ  active participation of women. Β  The mass protest staged at Vilappilsala in Thiruvananthapuram in 2012, against unregulated waste dumping, was led by panchayat president S Sobhanakumari. The campaign witnessed participation of women in large numbers. Β  β€Women-led agitations are a growing trend across the country. To mention a few, Aruna Roy campaigns for Right to Information and Teesta Setalvad and Medha Patkar for social causes. Men have become conditioned under the framework of political parties, and are often not willing to break it. Women, after many years of tolerance and oppression, are breaking that framework. They think, discuss and finally come out with protests against liquor shops, corruption and exploitative employers,β€ said activist and writer Sara Joseph.

The Union Home Ministry is examining the Gujarat governmentβ€™s complaint that the Ford Foundation is interfering in Indiaβ€™s internal affairs and abetting communal disharmony. The State government has accused it of encouraging the Sabrang Trust and the Citizens for Justice and Peace, run by Teesta Setalvad, social activist, to indulge in acts prejudicial to communal harmony. Violation Alleging violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act by the two non-governmental organisations, it asked for investigations into the purposes for which they spent the grants received from the U.S.-based funding agency. Denying the charge, Ms. Setalvad said the two NGOs had cooperated in the investigation conducted by a Home Ministry team. The team has submitted its report. In January, the Gujarat Police registered a case against Ms. Setalvad and her husband, Javed Anand, for allegedly cheating residents of the Gulberg Society of money collected by the NGOs in 2008.
The agency has been accused of interfering in countryβ€™s internal affairsThe Ford Foundation, a U.S.-based funding agency which has been accused by the Gujarat government of interfering in the countryβ€™s internal affairs and fanning communal disharmony, was put on the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) watch list on Thursday.

The ministry said it wanted to ensure that funds are utilised for \""bonafide welfare activities without compromising on concerns of national interest and security\"". The move came after the Gujarat government asked the home ministry to take action against the Foundation, alleging the US-based organisation was \""interfering in the internal affairs\"" of the country and also \""abetting communal disharmony\"" through an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad. Setalwad has been accused of embezzling funds meant for a museum for the 2002 Gujarat riot victims in Ahmedabad. She and her husband have for years fronted the campaign for justice for riot victims. There have been allegations that the recipient NGOs have not filed mandatory annual reports and balance sheets with the government. The ministry order also said government organisations can avail of funding from Ford Foundation only with clearance of the department of economic affairs. NGOs and lobby groups have been under scrutiny since last year after a report by the Intelligence Bureau said they had been preventing economic growth by campaigning against power projects, mining and genetically modified food. Early this month, the home ministry froze seven bank accounts of Greenpeace India and barred it from receiving foreign funds, for allegedly violating Foreign Contribution Regulation Act and \""prejudicially\"" affecting the country's public and economic interests.

"NEW DELHI: In a desperate bid to resurrect investigations into then chief minister Narendra Modi's alleged role in the 2002 Gujarat riots, dismissed IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt on Monday requested the Supreme Court to set up a special investigation team to probe the then state law officer's series of emails indicating a serious conspiracy to subvert justice. Bhatt had moved the SC four year ago accusing the then Modi government of attempting to blunt his untiring efforts to expose the state's role in fanning the riots by lodging an inspired FIR against him in 2011 accusing him of forcing a government servant to give false evidence to establish his presence during a high-level meeting called by the then CM to discuss the riots. READ ALSO: Gujarat cop Sanjiv Bhatt moves SC against murder case trial Bhatt moved the fresh application requesting the SC to add BJP president Amit Shah and S Gurumurthy as parties in his petition as they were \part of the larger design to subvert the course of justice\"", both before the SC and the trial court in the riot cases. His application was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu by senior advocate Indira Jaising. The application will be heard on Tuesday. The SC-appointed SIT headed by former CBI director R K Raghavan had given a clean chit to Modi after investigating similar charges made by Jakia Jafri, whose husband and former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri was killed by rioters. Bhatt, a known Modi-baiter, claimed he filed the application seeking impleadment of Shah, Gurumurthy and two Gujarat government officials - G C Murmu who was then principal secretary to Modi and then state home ministry official Vijay Badekha -- in his petition after stumbling upon \""incriminating material\"" in the emails of then additional advocate general and present additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta which showed that they were part of a conspiracy to subvert the course of justice in riot cases. READ ALSO: Suspended Gujarat IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt sacked Bhatt said he and Mehta enjoyed \""great friendship\"" till 2011 and the Mehta and Bhatt families vacationed together abroad several times. Such was the trust that Mehta had confided in Bhatt his email password. But, friend-turned-foe Bhatt used the password to search through Mehta's emails. \""Among large body of emails recovered from Mehta's account, certain correspondence merit the special attention of the Supreme Court in the context of making Shah, Gurumurthy and others a party in the pending petition,\"" the dismissed IPS officer said. He said the trail of emails showed the state government's affidavits, to be filed in the SC, were vetted by Shah, Gurumurthy and shared with counsel for riot accused, indicating a nexus between the government and the accused, a fact enough to subvert the course of justice. Bhatt said Gurumurthy had on April 14, 2010, sent a mail to Mehta, Shah and the latter's advocates Mahesh Jethmalani and Ram Jethmalani forwarding a copy of the Gujarat government's affidavit accompanied by a note suggesting additions and alterations to the state's affidavit. \""The matter in which this affidavit was to be filed was one pertaining to the Gujarat riot investigations, and the changes that had been made by Gurumurthy asked for an investigation into Teesta Setalvad and the organization started by her,\"" he alleged. He said on April 18, 2010, Shah forwarded to Mehta a note of Gurumurthy asking the then CM's principal secretary G C Murmu to send details needed to draft the affidavit. On the same day, \""Gurumurthy sent the draft affidavit of the Gujarat government, to be filed before the SC in the matter of riot cases, to Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Pranav Badheka and other advocates\"", he said. Bhatt said four days after Shah was arrested in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, Mehta \""sent nine documents to advocates for the accused and to the accused Amit Shah. These documents were designed to assist in the defence of Amit Shah\"". Giving details of more such emails, Bhatt said, \""These emails clearly substantiate the fact that the law officer representing the Gujarat government had been exchanging legal documents to be filed by the state while prosecuting an accused, to the lawyers of the accused, and a similar exchange was taking place reciprocally.\"" After giving details of emails, Bhatt said, \""Unless the Supreme Court directed a proper inquiry into the material submitted, the confidence of general public in free, fair and transparent trial would be eroded.\"""""

Stressing that a process has been on since then, she said each time this government came to power, their agenda was on the \""question of culture and education\"" and to push it. \""Today you have a brute majority government and quite naturally this agenda will be taken forward much more aggressively and it is being taken forward.\"" A \""talk was on\"" that the HRD Ministry was looking to push books of RSS ideologue Dina Nath Batra all over the country through the CBSE, she claimed and added that these books were already reaching about four lakh students in Gujarat. Asked if she would move court on the issue, Teesta said \""there is constant discussion among us on whether you can go to court on policy matters or build resistance otherwise.\"" On attacks on worship places in Northern India, she said these could not have happened without vilification campaign against Christians and conversions. \""Whether it was the attack on nun in West Bengal or Churches in Delhi it happens because of a systematic campaign built about Christians, Muslims and Dalits and it allows social sanction for violence.\"" Referring to BJP MP Adityanath, she said he should have been disqualified from Parliament 10 years ago. \""You have Parliamentarians indulging in most filthy kind of speech.\"" On communal polarisation vis-a-vis the social media, she said \""you see certain pattern trolling in Twitter and Facebook and it is not spontaneous.\"" There is \""huge money\"" being spent in creating a mood in social media which was not spontaneous, she said and added that there was a \""deliberate attempt to polarise and provoke.\"" She expressed solidarity with Tamil writers like Perumal Murugan who were targeted by some caste groups and supporters of RSS for \""offensive content.\"" On the importance of supporting survivors of communal violence, she alleged \""the attempt by the regime in power in Delhi and Gujarat is to actually remove us from the scene so that we don't give help to survivors and so that their testimonies are not protected in court.\""  """

"I am not trending on Twitter anymore. My wife of 41 years is happy, and so, to be truthful, am I. Those are not the three hours of being No. 1 on the New Delhi checklist of this social platform in cyberspace I particularly relish. Not because most of the Tweets were abusive, or even that many of them asked why no one \had yet taken me out\"", or wondered \""who will be first one to hit\"". Elsewhere in India, young reporters working on a pittance of a salary for micro newspapers in rural districts routinely suffer abuse, threats, and physical assaults. Once in a while, someone is shot, stabbed or just clobbered to death. Several years ago, a young reporter's wife was raped as punishment to him for having dared to report some grassroot reality. A professional hazard, as it were. Human rights defenders, social activists, rationalists writers--many of them are university teachers and quite few are young, middle aged and senior journalists--get abused, trolled and beaten by the police during protests. Some have been forced into silence. A few have announced their \""creative death\"". Of late, death, in Maharashtra and Karnataka, has been real, and violent (1, 2, 3). We are not here talking of not-for-profit groups, whose foreign funding is throttled, or stopped. Or such icons as Teesta Setalvad, whose historic work to get justice for the victims and survivors of the 2002 violence against Muslims in Gujarat, has seen her being hounded and persecuted as if for some medieval crime of lese majeste. We are minor mortals, persisting, albeit without pause, seeking that the state not encroach on citizenship rights of anyone, Tribals and Dalits, the poor and, in my case, specially of those of these who also have an additional identity of being Sikhs, Muslims or Christians. This is not something that is located in the India now governed by Mr. Narendra Modi. The United Progressive Alliance government of Dr. Manmohan Singh had its share of transgressions. And many of us had seen some level of persecution, and persecution, when the Bharatiya Janata party stalwart Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee was in power. \""With Twitter, far more anonymous than Facebook and blogs, social and political thuggery has a new weapon of choice.\"" Now, the smothering power of Mr. Modi's parliamentary majority, and the honest and open assertion by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of its desire to force-fit constitutional, democratic and republic India into its mold of religious nationalism, has been multiplied a thousand-fold by the advances in communication technology, and what is called social media. With Twitter, far more anonymous than Facebook and blogs, social and political thuggery has a new weapon of choice. Experts tell me that to \""trend', a particular person or catch-phrase has to be Tweeted, or written, a particular number of times in a small window of time. It will not do for tens of thousands of people to praise the Prime minister, for instance, or decry Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, over a period of a month. The two names will not trend. But do it over three hours, and they make it to Number one. It requires a cross between a military operation and an ideological cadre base good enough to win a small municipal election. \""The lesson came in the shape of 15,300 tweets and re-tweets with my name on them, and various levels of threats from people who may have never heard of me till then. \"" That is what happened with me. A group has always \""followed\"" me ever since I joined Twitter and started my daily routine of 140-character commentary. Every phrase was challenged, sometimes in offensive language and sometime more innocuously. Even during the general elections and state assembly polls. My biography on Wikipedia is altered for a few hours every day to paint me as a Christian bigot out to convert India. But one seemed to have triggered some unseen threshold, a Lakshman Rekha, in comments on two recent issues. One was the ban first on beef and then on any slaughter of animals for food in several states as a mark of respect to a religious sentiment. I asserted the citizen's right to the food of his or her choice, and perhaps foolishly, boasted of my own eclectic preferences in matters of meat, from beef and pork, to mussels and oysters. The other incident was a news about the arrest of the principal and another staff member of a school in Mumbai with a very Catholic sounding name. A spate of Tweets from persons with very nationalistic and patriotic names, or \""handles\"" as they are called, tweeted to me about my and every other Catholic being a pedophile. One, once again, made the mistake of meekly pointing out that the school was not run by the church, or any denomination, and the management was close to the political party in power. @JohnDayal Only so called Hindu swamis get noticed.

The lesson came in the shape of 15,300 tweets and re-tweets with my name on them, and various levels of threats from people who may have never heard of me till then. If they were indeed 15,300 separate, distinct persons, it would be a miracle of spontaneous mass action. Perhaps it was the handiwork of just a few dedicated persons working overtime in an air conditioned call centre somewhere. I do not know. Nor do I know who gave the command. An added dimension was added when personal mobile telephone numbers were put on Twitter with instructions to ring one up. One had to switch off the instrument after the first four calls of heavy breathing and gruff enquires about one's name. The Delhi police now tell me even they may never get to know. The police say that while Facebook is more amenable to queries from the Indian government and cooperate in identifying cyber-criminals, Twitter, with its main servers in the United States, does not, unless a Tweet meets the criminality criteria of the US with its Freedom of Expression tradition. Letters Rogatory, the diplomatic channel of request for information, are too tedious and time consuming. One is given some reassurance that those who threaten life and limb on twitter seldom carry out their threats. One supposes that is what will have to sustain morale as one walks along the menacing shadows in this cyber valley."""

New Delhi: In a format that is emerging as a regular pattern in the Modi government, union home secretary L C Goyal on Monday sought voluntary retirement and was replaced by a Rajasthan cadre IAS officer Rajiv Mehrishi, ironically on the day of his superannuation. Goyal, who was had served only seven months of his two year tenure, was later appointed as the chairman of the Indian Trade Promotion Organisation in the ministry of commerce. He is the second home secretary during the Modi government to have been shunted out of office before the completion of his mandatory two year tenure. Earlier this year Anil Goswami also took retirement following reports of his involvement in delaying the arrest of former union minister Matang Singh in the Saradha chit fund scam of West Bengal. In the year 2000, it was decided that key officials like the home secretary and external affairs secretary would have a minimum two year tenure, but in the Modi government Goyal has become the third officer to be moved out of a high office before the completion of this period. Former foreign secretary Sujatha Singh was also eased out of her office and replaced by SΒ  Jaishankar. The opposition Congress has seen a pattern in these changes and attributes it to the desire of the prime minister Narendra Modi to concentrate the entire decision making process into his hands. β€The earlier systems of making these appointments through the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC) has been given a go by, and now the cabinet ministers are not a part of this committee. The committee consists of just the prime minister and the home minister, and the ministers are only informed about the decisions,β€ said party spokesperson and former union home minister Anand Sharma. He said that the security of the tenure is a decision of the cabinet to ensure that the bureaucrats are able to discharge their duty without any pressure. β€We do not have the concept of a committed bureaucracy and this safety is guaranteed by the constitution. But making such changes the Modi government is taking away the independence of the bureaucrats,β€ he added. Though Goyal has denied that he had any differences with the government and was resigning for personal reasons, there have been reports that he has become a victim of the cross fire between the union finance minister Arun Jaitley and the union home minister Rajnath Singh, whose differences date back to the period when the party was in opposition. In particular, Goyalβ€™s handling of the licencing for the Sun TV channels, the Naga peace accord and the Teesta Setalvad cases are reported to have drawn the ire of the powers that be. But the inadvertent beneficiary of this episode is the Rajasthan cadre officer Rajiv Mehrishi who was getting ready for his farewell on his day of superannuation and landed into this hot seat.

Ahmedabad:Β The Gujarat High Court today issued notices to the state government and a complainant on a plea by social activist Teesta Setalvad seeking quashing of an FIR in a case in which she is accused of putting objectionable pictures of Hindu deities on a popular social networking site. Justice J B Pardiwala issued notices to government and Raju Patel, the complainant, over Setalvadβ€™s plea to quash the FIR against her registered at Gathlodia Police Station here. The HC also asked the Investigating Officer in the case to remain present before it on September 30, the next date of hearing. The FIR was filed in August last year on a complaint by Patel who said Setalvad had uploaded objectionable images of Hindu Gods and Goddesses on her account on Twitter, thus hurting the majority communityβ€™s religious sentiments. She was booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 153(a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups) and section 205(a) (committing a deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings by insulting religion or religious beliefs) along with IT Act. The 53-year-old activist had later apologised and removed the images from her Twitter account.
New Delh:Β In fresh crackdown on an NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, the Home Ministry today suspended its registration for six months accusing the organisation of violating Foreign Currency (Regulation) Act that invites termination of its licence. In an order, the Home Ministry said exercising the powers conferred under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, the registration of Sabrang Trust has been suspended for a period of 180 days with effect from September 10, 2015. The Sabrang Trust, run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, can make a representation against the order within 30 days. However, if the Home Ministry is not satisfied with the reply of the NGO, its registration will be cancelled. Another NGO run by Teesta and her husband, Citizens for Justice and Peace, has already been put under prior permission category, thus making it mandatory for the organisation to take permission from the Home Ministry before accepting or utilising any foreign contribution. Following a recommendation of the Home Ministry, CBI has registered a case and launched a probe against Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited, a commercial firm run by Teesta, for allegedly accepting and utilising foreign contribution in violation of FCRA. Teesta has pursued the cases of post-Godhra riots victims in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister of the state. Todayβ€™s Home Ministry order said that during the course of inspection of records of Sabrang Trust, it was noticed that both Teesta and Javed Anand are chief functionary or trustee of the NGO. Both are also working as directors, co-editors, printers and publisher in the company namely Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) and published a magazine called β€Communalism Combatβ€™. SCPPL had accepted contribution from foreign source, thus violating FCRA, it said. On inspection of accounts of Sabrang Trust, it was noticed that the Association has received total donation of Rs 48.42 lakh and Rs 49.10 lakh in 2010-11 and 2011-12 respectively out of which they have spent Rs 30.97 lakh and Rs 27.07 lakh which comes to 64.23 per cent and 55.14 per cent respectively, on administrative expenses. As per section 8 (1)(b) of FCRA 2010 requires approval of the Home Ministry before incurring expenses on administrative head exceeding 50 per cent limit. Thus, it is a violation of FCRA, the ministry said. During the course of inspection of books and records of the NGO by the Home Ministry, it was noticed that payments of Rs 50 lakh were made by Sabrang Trust to Sabrang Communications & Publishing Pvt, Limited which seems to have been used for personal gain. On review of vouchers of Sabrang Trust, it has been noticed that the Association has transferred Rs 2.46 lakh from foreign contribution designated account to Sabrang Trustβ€™s domestic account without any logical reason. This raises the suspicion of mixing of funds by the Association and it can be treated as non-utilisation of foreign contribution for the purpose for which it was received and mixing of foreign contribution with domestic contribution. This is violation of FCRA, the ministry contended. On review of vouchers of the Association, it is found that Sabrang Trust has made direct payments of approximately Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit cards belonging to Teesta and Javed Anand respectively as payments. The cards are issued in the name of individuals and the above mentioned payments appears that the foreign contribution has been used for personal gain and not authorised as per FCRA. Sabrang Trust paid Rs 1,174 for purchasing an internal medical policy in favour of Anand for attending a conference in Lahore and Rs 4,227 was paid to Anand for purchasing books and travel expenses for attending the People Union for Civil Liberty meeting. The Home Ministry said that from the payments it appears that foreign contribution has been used for personal gain, thus violating FCRA provisions. The Home Ministry said that during inspection of books and records of the NGO, it was noticed that payments of Rs 50 lakh were made by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL which appears to have been used for personal gain. SCPPL is not registered under FCRA and not entitled to accept foreign contribution by any means.
New Delhi Β : The Supreme Court on Friday extended by four weeks the interim protection from arrest granted to Teesta Setalvad and her husband in a case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulbarg Society that was devastated in the 2002 riots. A bench comprising Justices A R Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel said the interim protection from arrest will continue till October 15. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the issue on behalf of the couple, saying the interim order was expiring on September 15. Setalvad challenged the order of the Gujarat High Court denying them anticipatory bail in the case.
 Updated: August 12, 2015 5:43 am A file photo of Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand outside a court in Mumbai. (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar) Stating that there was no need for custodial interrogation of activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Bombay High Court Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to them and said it is unable to find any threat to national security or public interest if they remain free. β€Prima facie, I am unable to find any threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state or a threat to its security or economic interest (if they remain free),β€ Justice Mridula Bhatkar said. β€A citizen may conduct social activities and may have a different point of view, which may not be liked by the government. However, in a democratic state, a citizen may have his or her point of view,β€ Justice Bhatkar said, adding that it is the duty of the state to protect such views.  β€If the prosecution says it is a snake, the court has to distinguish if it is a snake or a rope. Even if it is a snake, the court has to further see if it is a poisonous or a non-poisonous snake. And even then if it is a poisonous snake, the court has to decide if can be fatal,β€ it observed. It is alleged that the Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, run by the couple, received foreign funds without government approval and the amount was diverted to Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd. The FIR was lodged after the Home Ministry found alleged discrepancies by the two NGOs under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). Teesta and Anand were accused of embezzlement of around $290,000 between 2004 and 2008. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, along with public prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, argued that Teesta and her husband have criminal antecedents in Gujarat. He argued that her trust acted like an β€agentβ€ in India for the US-based Ford Foundation. Therefore, these acts were a threat to the sovereignty of the nation and its secular democracy, it was argued. But the court observed that there is no threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state, nor to its security, strategy or economic interest. β€The submissions made by the ASG that it is a threat to secular democracy cannot be appreciated,β€ said Justice Bhatkar. Appearing for the applicants, senior lawyers Aspi Chinoy and Mihir Desai said, β€It is well known that several convictions were made after the 2002 riots with the assistance of documents made available by Sabrang trust.β€ They argued that the FIR against the couple was a fallout of those convictions. Chinoy argued that most allegations in the CBIβ€™s FIR against the couple are β€Kafkaesqueβ€ in nature. He argued that the allegations were of disturbing communal harmony and pluralism in the country, but there was no basis for the same. On the allegations of receiving foreign funds, the court said, β€Prima facie, after going through the submission of the prosecutionβ€¦ it appears there may be some kind of misuse of the amount.β€ The court allowed the couple to furnish one surety of Rs 20,000 in case they are arrested.

 Published:August 25, 2015 4:36 am The Mehdi Nawaz Jung Hall in Ahmedabad. (Source: Express photo by Javed Raja) An Ahmedabad hall widely used by civil rights organisations has been made out of bounds by Gujarat Governor O P Kohli for β€any political activity or any activity against the governmentβ€. A kabulatnama or written undertaking that there will be no such activity has been made mandatory for anyone who wishes to book the Mehdi Nawaz Jung Hall, named after the first Governor of Gujarat. This follows an β€oral decisionβ€ by Governor Kohli. The Mehdi Nawaz Jung Hall has been the venue of several meetings, including those on the 2002 riots, screening of films on the riots, and where the riot-hit have spoken out. More recently, the hall hosted organisations which backed Teesta Setalvad, the social activist booked by police for alleged embezzlement of funds meant for riot victims, and others critical of the Centreβ€™s crackdown on NGOs. The hall is part of the Himavan complex which is administered by a board of trustees of the Governorβ€™s Social Welfare Fund. The Governor is one of the trustees and chairman of the board. Responding to an application filed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information Act, Raj Bhavan said the decision on a kabulatnama was taken on May 26, 2015 β€” a day after expelled AAP leader Yogendra Yadav was denied entry to the hall despite a booking by organisers of a meeting. Yadav then held a meeting with workers outside the hall. In its reply, the Governorβ€™s Office said: β€Since the persons who approach the management of Mehdi Nawaz Jung Hall, Paldi, Ahmedabad for booking the hall are orally instructed to give their kabulatnama to the effect that they will not use the hall for any political activity or any activity against the government, the hall is not given on rent to any party which refuses to give a signed kabulatnama.β€ β€The hall is currently booked for carrying out educational, social, humanitarian and cultural activities,β€ the reply stated. The Indian Express had also sought minutes of the meeting in which such a decision was taken. To this, Raj Bhavan said: β€Meetings were not held and no notings were made while taking this decision, so the question of giving copies thereof does not arise.β€ Gautam Thaker, general secretary of the Peopleβ€™s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) in Gujarat, who is also administrator of the hall, said he had not been informed about the decision. β€I have not been intimated about the decision. I handle issues like salaries of the staff of the hall etc. The booking part is being handled by a watchman who is also performing the role of a manager,β€ he said. Thaker criticised the insistence on a written undertaking. β€I think it is a move to stifle the voice of dissent. It is an attempt to suppress the freedom of speech and expression of civil society,β€ he said.  
 Published:September 4, 2015 4:01 am Ramdas wrote in the email that the government was β€particularly displeasedβ€ about the grants and that it would take a long time for the foundation to normalise relations. Four months after the government asked Ford Foundation to route its grants in India through the Home Ministry, the organisation has transferred its country head, Kavita Ramdas, to its headquarters in New York. In an email addressed to β€extended familyβ€, Ramdas indicated that her move might be linked to the governmentβ€™s probe against the foundation for its grants to Sabrang Trust run by activist Teesta Setalvad.Β Ramdas wrote in the email that the government was β€particularly displeasedβ€ about the grants and that it would take a long time for the foundation to normalise relations.  β€β€¦last yearβ€¦has been rocky with the Government of India challenging civil society in India at all levels and being particularly displeased with the Ford Foundationβ€™s support some years ago to well-known human rights activist Teesta Setalvad. While these events long preceded my tenure at the foundation, and while the foundation has since sought to signal an effort to reset the relationship between Ford and GoI, moving forward we were aware that this likely to be a long term effort with many more bumps along the way,β€ Ramdas wrote. Admitting that she had intended to have a longer tenure as the foundationβ€™s representative in New Delhi, she wrote that the plan had to be altered because of the governmentβ€™s stance towards the foundation. β€In the process, our plans for a slightly longer Indian sojourn have been β€modi-fiedβ€ so to speak!,β€ she wrote. When contacted, Ramdas directed The Indian Express to a statement the foundation released announcing her transfer to New York where she will work from November as advisor to its president Darren Walker. Apart from praising the work done by Ramdas in India, the statement quoted Walker as saying: β€Our priority is to ensure that our work and that of the organisations we support is tailored to each unique setting where we operate, responding meaningfully to local contexts and the many appearances of inequality.β€ Earlier this year, the Gujarat police had initiated an inquiry into alleged financial mismanagement at the Sabrang Trust, including the grants it had received from the Ford Foundation. In April, the Home Ministry had placed the foundation on a β€watch-listβ€™ and said all of the foundationβ€™s grants would henceforth have to be cleared by the ministry. On August 11, the Bombay High Court granted anticipatory bail to Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand who were booked by the CBI under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). It is alleged that the Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, run by the couple, received foreign funds, including from Ford Foundation, without government approval and diverted the amount to Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd. The government has accused the trust of acting like an β€agentβ€ in India for Ford Foundation. Setalvad and Anand have also been at the forefront of various agitations and legal battles with the Gujarat government over its alleged role in the 2002 riots.  
 Updated: September 11, 2015 2:42 am Social activist Teesta Setalvad. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday suspended the registration of activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s Sabrang Trust under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA) for a period of 180 days, owing to alleged violation of the Actβ€™s provisions. The MHA alleges that Sabrang Trust violated FCRA provisions that prohibit columnists, editors, owners, printers or publishers of a registered newspaper from accepting foreign contributions, and transfer of foreign contribution to other parties that have not been registered. It has also been accused of mixing of foreign and domestic contribution, and utilisation of foreign contribution for seemingly personal gains and unauthorised purposes. According to the order, on the basis of available inputs against the association, an on-site inspection of its records and accounts was conducted from April 9 to 11 at its registered office in Mumbai, and the findings were communicated to Sabrang Trust on June 5. The ministry, the order stated, examined the reply given by the association, through its letter dated June 2015, and found it unsatisfactory on various grounds.  The order also said that during inspection of records, it was noticed that both Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand were Chief Functionary/Trustee of associations of Sabrang Trust, registered under FCRA,1976 (repealed with FCRA, 2010). It added that during the probe it was found that they were running a magazine Communalism Combat as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. This, the order said, was in violation of Section 3 (1) (b) and (h) of FCRA, 2010. According to the order, Sabrang Trust spent 64.23 per cent (2010-11) and 55.14 per cent (2011-12) of their grant on administrative expenses. This, it alleged, violated section 8 (1) (b) of FCRA, 2010 that calls for MHA approval before incurring expenses on administrative head exceeding fifty per cent limit. Citing violation of different FCRA provisions, the order also alleged that payments of Rs 50 lakh, made by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL, were used for personal gains. In January 2011, the order said, Sabrang Trust allegedly transferred an amount of Rs 2,46,954 from its foreign contribution designated account to Sabrang Trust domestic account β€without any logical reasonsβ€, which β€raises the suspicion of mixing of funds by the association and it can be treated as non-utilisation of foreign contribution for the purpose which it was received and mixing of foreign contribution with domestic contribution.β€  
 Published:September 12, 2015 1:58 am Β  Setalvad and her husband have challenged the order of the Gujarat High Court, denying them anticipatory bail in the case. The Supreme Court on Friday extended by another four weeks protection from arrest granted to Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in a case of alleged embezzlement of funds meant for constructing a museum in the memory of 2002 Gujarat riot victims. A bench of Justices A R Dave and Adarsh K Goel said the interim protection from arrest will continue till October 15. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal mentioned the issue on behalf of the couple, saying the interim order was expiring on September 15.  Setalvad and her husband have challenged the order of the Gujarat High Court, denying them anticipatory bail in the case. The high court order was stayed by the apex court and awaits a hearing by a three-judge bench. The apex court had on April 16 constituted a three-judge bench to hear afresh the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad and her husband as a two-judge bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Goel referred the issue to a larger bench. The couple have denied all charges levelled by the Gujarat Police, which in an affidavit in July had alleged that they had misappropriated funds meant for charity for personal expenses buying items ranging from wine to mobile phone, besides tampering with evidence. Teesta and her husband, who have been fighting for justice for the riots victims, have denied all allegations contending that they have been implicated in the case and were victims of political vendetta.  
 Mumbai: In what is seen as a relief for social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Supreme Court today stayed their arrest till tomorrow in the Gulbarg Society fund embezzlement case. Gujarat Police personnel on Thursday reached the Mumbai residence of social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand to arrest them for the alleged embezzlement of money meant for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. The activist reportedly was not present at home when the police team reached her Mumbai residence, and some reports said that she had left town due to a family event. Earlier in the day, the Gujarat High Court rejected the anticipatory bail plea filed by Setalvad, Anand and others in the case of the alleged embezzlement of over Rs 1.5 crore. Justice JB Pardiwala had on January 30 reserved the order on the bail petitions filed by Setalvad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri (whose father and former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri was killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots) and Firoz Gulzar, a resident of the Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad. Teesta is facing charges that she misused the funds raised by her NGOs, Sabrang and Citizens for Justice and Peace, in the name of riots victims. India TV had earlier reported that the social activist managed to divert nearly Rs 4 crore out of total collected Rs 10 crore donations in the name of riots victims and spent the sum of amount on her family. Teestaβ€™s NGOs had got Rs 10 core donations from different sources, including overseas, for the construction of Museum of Resistance in Ahmedabadβ€™s Gulberg Society. The social activist β€utilisedβ€™ Rs 3.75 crore on her familyβ€™s foreign trips. The donations were amassed between 2008 to 2012.

" New Delhi/Mumbai: In a big relief to social activist Teesta Setalvad, Supreme Court today stayed her arrest till February 19. Yesterday, The Police had reached Mumbai to arrest 2002-Gujarat riotsβ€™ activist Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand after Gujarat High Courtβ€™s rejection of their bail plea. After that Setalvad moved the Supreme Court for a dayβ€™s reprieve from arrest in the case of alleged misuse of funds meant for rehabilitation of 2002 post-Godhra victims. The relief came after a couple of hours only when senior advocate Kapil Sibal made a dramatic mention of the couple's anticipatory bail plea before a bench of three judges headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu, and Justices A K Sikri and Arun Mishra and sought an urgent hearing on the case. According to a Times of India report, he told the court that it was an extraordinary situation and the court needed to intervene urgently as the state police was hell bent to arrest Teesta on the same day. The bench immediately restrained the state police from arresting them till Friday, when their appeal against the HC decision would be heard in the Supreme Court. Setalvad and her husband reportedly submitted that the FIR was registered solely for the purpose of harassing them as there was no merit in the charges. Setalvad and her NGO \Citizens for Justice and Peace\"" were instrumental in bringing the Gujarat riot cases like that of Best Bakery and Jakia Jafriβ€™s case to the Supreme Court. While rejecting her bail plea, HC strongly condemned her alleged spending of funds collected to help the riot victims for her personal indulgence. Court also questioned the functioning of her NGO. The HC had, however, granted anticipatory bail to three riot victims, former residents of Gulbarg Society and co-accused in the embezzlement case - former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri's son Tanvir, society's chairman Salim Sandhi and secretary Firoz Gulzar. They were granted bail on the conditions that they would furnish a bond of Rs 10,000 and cooperate with investigation. In this case, HC refused to grant bail as the court felt that the facts of this case were quite shocking and disturbing. As mentioned in the daily, the court said that how can one seek materialistic pleasure and happiness at the expense of poor and needy persons? How can one even use five paise which is meant for the poor and the needy? HC said, \""The facts of this case reflect the sorry state of affairs of NGOs. The donations are made with lot of trust and hope that ultimately the money would reach the poor and needy. However, here is a case where in the name of the poor, needy and unfortunate riot-affected victims, lakhs of rupees was received and embezzled\"". The court considered the case as a fit one for custodial interrogation in public interest. As a matter of fact, in January 2014, a complaint was filed by former residents of Gulbarg society against Feroze Khan Pathan, Setalvad, and others for allegedly consuming Rs 1.51 crore collected for a riot museum. Residents had alleged they were restrained from selling their property on the promise that NGOs would buy them. Citing lack of funds, the promise was not fulfilled.

 Mumbai: While the Supreme Court has put a stay on the arrest of 2002-Gujarat riots activist Teesta Setalvad till February 19, she, on Saturday, has demanded an independent probe to be conducted by any agency outside Gujarat and supervised by the Supreme Court. Saying that she and her husband were β€extremely disturbed and upsetβ€ by the Gujarat High Court Order, which cancelled their anticipatory plea on Thursday; Setalvad also questioned the credentials of Gujarat Crime Branch.

Can such an Investigation ever be impartial or not vindictive?β€ After having gone through the 63-page long High Court order, she said that it was β€painfully clear that the court has disregarded over 1500 pages of documentary evidenceβ€ that she has supplied since June 2014 in response to the allegations put on her by the Gujarat Police Crime Branch. As reported by The Hindu, she said, β€We ask for fair hearing, not privilege.β€ She said that they will answer each and every charge piece by piece with documentary evidence. She claimed that they have done no wrong and have functioned legitimately. β€But in a truly free and fair country, the facts need to be examined in detail and dispassionatelyβ€, she said. She also accused the large sections of media for acting like khap panchayats while searching her.

 New Delhi: The new bench of Supreme Court appointed to take the decision on the bail plea of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband has extended the stay on her arrest. The top court had directed Setalvad and her NGOs to provide list of documents and means of donors as sought by Gujarat police. In case, Teesta and her husband do not cooperate in the probe, then the court directed the Gujarat police to file an application for cancellation of their bail. Reportedly, earlier in the hearing, SC had asked the Gujarat government why Teesta Setalvad and her husband were needed in custody for questioning. Court noted that it is a matter of restraining somebodyβ€™s liberty. Apparently, Gujarat police was hunting them to question in case of alleged misappropriation of funds worth 1.5 crore allocated for rehabilitation of 2002 Gujarat riot victims. The new bench comprises of Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Goel. As a surprise development in the case, Chief Justice HL Dattu had assigned the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad to the new bench although there was no recusal from the previous bench of Justices S J Mukhopadhaya and N V Ramana which had stayed her arrest till Thursday.

" New Delhi: In a surprise development on social activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s case, chief justice HL Dattu has transferred the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad to a new bench of the court. Although, none of the two judges who had stayed her arrest till Thursday have sought recusal in any form (oral or written) from the hearing however still, the case has been transferred to a new bench of two judges - Justices Dipak Misra and Adarsh Goel. Earlier, till February 13, the petitions were heard by bench of justices S J Mukhopadhaya and N V Ramana. According to a report published in Times of India, earlier Justices Mukhopadhyaya and NV Ramana had heard petitions by Setalvad and her husband, who were accused of allegedly misusing the donations meant for construction of a museum for riot victims of 2002 Gujarat riots.Β  Β  Later, the judges stayed their arrest by Gujarat police until Thursday. Reportedly, Setalvadβ€™s counsel Kapil Sibal had said, β€If she is arrested and sent to jail, the voice of dissent against the might of a state will be lost. She is ready to face investigation. This is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail. Please don't allow Gujarat Police to arrest her.\ However, the bench unaffected by the poignant statements said that it will not get swayed by sentiments and stature of a person before them and it will treat this case like any other. Apparently, it is the CJI who decides which case goes to which bench however; this is not done before receiving any written or oral requests for recusal from a particular judge which in this case was missing. The change of bench in this case is welcomed by many as it is learnt that Narendra Modi was an invitee of and recently attended the weddings of children of Justices Mukhopadhyaya and Ramana who were hearing the case of Teesta till February 13. Teesta has alleged in this case that she is being hounded by Gujarat police since she had played a leading role in exposing the role of Modi in Gujarat riots of 2002 and is seeking accountability for it.

In a 24-hour reprieve for activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Supreme Court on Thursday stayed their arrest in a case of alleged misappropriation of funds for a memorial at Gulberg housing society, one of the areas devastated in the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat.  Just an hour after the Gujarat High Court dismissed the coupleβ€™s plea for anticipatory bail plea in the case, senior advocate Kapil Sibal made an urgent oral plea on their behalf before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India H.L. Dattu. Noting that his clients were met with an β€extraordinary situationβ€, Mr. Sibal sought the courtβ€™s protection from arrest and to hear them on Friday.  The Bench, which was in the midst of hearing another matter, accepted Mr. Sibalβ€™s plea and posted the matter for hearing on Friday. It further stayed the Gujarat police from arresting the couple during the interim. Our correspondent Rahi Gaikwad reports from Ahmedabad: Setalvads not cooperating: Gujarat HC Even as the Supreme Court stayed the arrest of social activists Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Gujarat High Court stressed on the need for their custodial interrogation, while rejecting their plea for anticipatory bail on Thursday. It refused to grant them anticipatory bail in the Gulberg Society fund embezzlement case on the grounds that they did not cooperate with the investigators and that the allegations were serious. The court said β€there is no cooperation at allβ€ from the couple. β€The applicants want to evade the interrogation and are not readyβ€¦ to disclose the true facts. If such are the answers given by the applicants to the questions put by the investigating officer at a stage when they are underβ€¦ an oral interim protection, I wonder what would be the position when they [are] armed with a full-fledged anticipatory bail order. It is at that stageβ€¦ that the custodial interrogation becomes very important,β€ Justice J.B. Pardiwala said in his order.   
"The Supreme Court on Friday extended its stay on the arrest of activist Teesta Setalvad in the Gulbarg society embezzlement case funds, even as her counsel Kapil Sibal tried to convince the court that there are very few people out there like her who can take on the might of the State. The Bench led by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya ordered the continuation of the stay till February 19, the next date of hearing on her plea for anticipatory bail against arrest. The Gujarat High Court had dismissed her plea on Thursday, following which she urgently moved the supreme court. The supreme court had stayed the arrest till the matter was heard today. The bench said it will consider her plea for anticipatory bail \independently\"" and asked Mr. Sibal to not convert this into a political issue. \""We will not go by any name, we will consider this like any other anticipatory bail plea. On the next date, rest assured we will give justice for both (Teesta's side and the State of Gujarat), but there will be relief for only one of you,\"" Justice Mukhopadhaya said. Starting his arguments, Mr. Sibal read out the allegations against Teesta and her husband, Javed Anand. He said the Gujarat police claims to have found evidence that she enticed foreign donors to contribute in heavily by showing the photographs of the 2002 post-Godhra riot victims. \""We provided the investigating agencies and the high court with 1500 pages of documents on every entry made by us. If one of these entries is wrong or false, I am prepared to go in. But the high court did not even refer to these documents before dismissing my bail plea . Why did not these so-called 'wealthy foreigners' lodge any complaints against us?\"" Mr. Sibal submitted. He said \""we stand here before Your Lordships with the passion of our convictions. Don't allow the mighty State to destroy us. This court is our last resort.\"" Mr. Sibal said how the police had reached Teesta's residence at 2.30 pm, even before the high court dismissed her bail plea at 4 pm. \""If this is the case, none of us are safe anymore,\"" Mr. Sibbal said. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for Gujarat government said the evidence found against Teesta was \""shocking\"" and revealed \""foreign travels, branded clothes.\"" Concluding the hearing, the bench gave both parties liberty to file additional documents."""
"Even as the Supreme Court has put a stay on her arrest till February 19, social activist Teesta Setalvad on Saturday demanded that an independent investigation be conducted by any agency outside Gujarat supervised by the Supreme Court. Ms. Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and others are accused of embezzlement of funds meant for the construction of a memorial for the Gujarat 2002 riot victims. She has termed the allegations \baseless.\"" Saying that they were \""extremely disturbed and upset\"" by the Gujarat High Court Order, which cancelled their anticipatory bail recently, Ms. Setalvad also raised questions on the Gujarat Crime Branch's credentials. \""We are and have always been prepared for a transparent and fair investigation. But can the Crime Branch today within Gujarat have collected documented evidence and also launched prosecutions that are pending? Can such an Investigation ever be impartial or not vindictive?β€ Ms. Setalvad asked in a Facebook post. After a detailed reading of the 63-page order of the HC, she said it was \""painfully clear that the Court has disregarded over 1500 pages of documentary evidence supplied by us since June 2014 in response to every single one of the allegations put out by the Gujarat Police Crime Branch.\"" \""We ask for fair hearing, not privilege,β€ Ms. Setalvad said.Β  \""We will answer each and every charge, piece by piece, with documentary evidence. We have done no wrong. We have functioned legitimately. But in a truly free and fair country, the facts need to be examined in detail and dispassionately.\"" SheΒ accused large sections of television media for acting like khap panchayats in hounding her.Β  \""It is shocking that large sections of the television media have been like a khap panchayat not even attempting to go into both sides,\"" she said."""
Noam Chomsky and Sheldon Pollack join scores of people in expressing solidarity with activistThree days before the Supreme Court is to hear final arguments in activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s plea for anticipatory bail, lawyers, journalists and civil rights activists on Monday termed the move to arrest her and her husband Javed Anand for β€custodial questioningβ€ as part of a larger effort to silence dissent. The couple has been accused of embezzlement of funds meant for the construction of a memorial for the Gujarat 2002 riot victims. In a statement issued under the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust banner, political theorist Noam Chomsky and Sanskrit scholar Sheldon Pollack joined scores of academics and concerned citizens to express solidarity with Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand. On their possible prosecution over charges of financial misappropriation, the statement said: β€We see this as a clear case of the politics of vendetta launched with explicit intent to whitewash and efface from public memory the misdeeds of those who today wield political power in the State and at the Centre.β€ Addressing a related meeting, former Additional Solicitor-General Indira Jaising said the two were being targeted because they had helped Zakia Jafri β€“ widow of parliamentarian Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the riots β€“ get justice. Questioning the rationale in trying to arrest the duo in a case based entirely on paperwork, she said the idea was to strike fear in the hearts of people who stand up to those currently in power. β€It is not just to teach Teesta a lesson, but to all of us also,β€™β€™ she said, echoing a point made by the National Integration Council member John Dayal earlier. He underlined the fact that β€Teesta has taken on not just the ruling apparatus but the king himself, Narendra Modiβ€™β€™. Of the view that freedom of expression is under attack from various quarters, editor of Jansatta Om Thanvi said the media could not afford to remain silent. β€Remain silent now at your own peril,β€™β€™ he warned fellow journalists.
"Welcoming the stay by the Supreme Court on the arrest of rights activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the human Rights organisation, Peopleβ€™s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), alleged that the Gujarat policeβ€™s insistence on β€custodial interrogationβ€ was a β€veiled threat of third degree methods.β€  Earlier this moth, the Gujarat High Court dismissed Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anandβ€™s plea for anticipatory bail which was stayed soon after by the Supreme Court till February 19.  In a statement issued on Wednesday, PUCL alleged that Ms. Seetalvad β€is being targeted through false affairs.β€ Pointing out that the allegation against Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand in a case of alleged misappropriation of funds for a memorial at Gulberg housing society, one of the areas devastated in the 2002 post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, the rights organisation claimed that there was no need of their immediate arrest.  β€It is necessary also to point out that the accusation against Teesta and are not of having committed heinous offences but financial ones, all of which can be established or disapproved mainly on documentary evidences,β€ the PUCL statement said.  Citing the Supreme Court judgement in the case of Joginder Kumar versus State of UP, PUCL said that in the judgment the court pointed out that the arrest of person can cause β€incalculable harm to his or her reputation.\ """
Decision coincides with Prashant Bhushan poser on β€proprietyβ€In what is seen as an unexpected turn, a new Bench of the Supreme Court will hear an application for anticipatory bail filed by activist Teesta Setalvad, who is facing possible arrest in the Gulberg Society funds embezzlement case, on Thursday. The decision to change the Bench came to light on Wednesday evening when the Supreme Court posted its case list for Thursday on its official website. It shows the case listed before a new Bench of Justice Dipak Misra and Justice A.K. Goel. The case was heard last week by a Bench of Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya and Justice N.V. Ramana. The Bench granted Ms. Setalvad and her husband, Javed Anand, interim protection from arrest till Thursday. Ms. Setalvad is accused of enticing foreign donors to make huge contributions by showing photographs of the 2002 post-Godhra riot victims. The couple had moved the SC after the Gujarat High Court dismissed Ms. Setalvadβ€™s plea last Thursday. The Supreme Courtβ€™s decision to change the Bench coincides with a statement issued by counsel Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday to the media, questioning the β€proprietyβ€ of Justices Mukhopadhaya and Ramana. β€It has been brought to my notice that Mr. Narendra Modi was an invitee of, and recently attended, the weddings of the children of Justices Mukhopadhaya and Ramana, who are hearing the case of Teesta Setalvad. The allegation of Teesta in this case is that she is being hounded by the Gujarat Police since she had played a leading role in exposing the role of Modi in the Gujarat carnage of 2002, and is seeking accountability for it. In these circumstances, the question has arisen whether it would be appropriate for these judges to hear this case,β€ Mr. Bhushan said in an e-mail.
"Personal liberty cannot be put on the ventilator in an ICU, says the Supreme CourtRemarking that \personal liberty cannot be put in the ventilator\"", the Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its judgment on a plea for anticipatory bail by activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in the Gulbarg society embezzlement case, while continuing with its interim stay on her arrest. \""Give me liberty or give me death. Personal liberty is paramount. No one will barter his or her liberty for all the teas in China, for all the pearls in the sea and for all the stars in the sky,\"" Justice Dipak Misra, who led the bench also comprising Justice A.K. Goel, conveyed to Gujarat police the importance of what Ms. Setalvad is seeking from the highest court. Arguments started with senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for Ms. Setalvad saying that no citizen or State is above the law. He said that the Gujarat government \""cannot take upon itself the task of persecuting someone who has criticised the State for its actions\"". He said that this is the seventh instance when the State lodged an FIR against her. The former six, the SC had protected her liberty, Mr. Sibal submitted. Mr. Sibal challenged the Gujarat government to point to one entry in the 11,000 pages of documents submitted in court that showed that Ms. Setalvad had routed money collected from foreign donors inthe names of the 2002 riot victims for her personal expenses. He branded the state's enquiry as \""roving\"". Justice Misra asked Gujarat counsel Mahesh Jethmalani whether \""this is a case in which personal liberty should be taken away... it may be a case in which there may be irregularities in accounts. But what is there to warrant a personal interrogation?\"" Mr. Jethmalani appearing for the Gujarat government denied any malafide on the part of the State. He said the police had received complaints received from 12 Gulbarg residents on March 12, 2013 and launched a preliminary enquiry into the allegations. \""We did not harass anybody,\"" Mr. Jethmalani submitted. He accused Ms. Setalvad of \""rank non co-operation and tampering with witnesses\"". Here Mr. Sibal rose to challenge him : \""Show it. Prove it.\"" Mr. Jethmalani read out the riot victims' complaint, in whcih he quoted how they were \""fed up of her false promises\"" to build a memorial for Gulbarg victims and buy their houses at a fair value. The senior counsel said setalvad's trust collected over Rs. 8 crore through donations despite their protests to stop. He said how when the pressure from the victims peaked, Ms Setalvad had told them that the money collected for the museum was not enough and the victims could sell their houses on their own. \""You say you are a trustee acting for the victims but when the shoe is on the other foot, you turn tail,\"" Mr. Jethmalani submitted. He further accused Ms Setalvad of \""arrogance\"" shown to the investigating agency. To this, Justice Misra asked whether Ms. Setalvad had not come on any day she was summoned by the police. Here, Mr. Jethmalani replied that she was called twice and she had come on both occasions. \""But she had stock answers for all our questions, \"" the senior counsel added. \""There may be basically a mismanagement of accounts,\"" Justice Misra orally observed. Justice Misra further observed that stalvad is obliged under law to provide all documents to the probe agency and merely to secure these records her personal liberty need not be taken away. \""You don't act smart. Produce all the documents,\"" Justice Misra turned to Mr. Sibal. Mr. Sibal agreed to produce documents relevant, but submitted that the police should not use this FIR into an enquiry \""into everything\"" about Setalvad's Trust. The hearing concluded with a short order from the bench extending its protection from arrest. """
β€Facts twisted in an effort to malign her workβ€™Terming corruption charges against Teesta Setalvad baseless, civil society on Tuesday stood behind the social activist and her husband Javed Anand. If BJP president Amit Shah, who faced grievous murder charges in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, could get the luxury of not having to appear before court, why were Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand being subjected to a β€witch-huntβ€ over charges of financial corruption, activists in Mumbai asked. After the Gujarat High Court rejected their anticipatory bail plea on charges of embezzlement of funds meant for the 2002 Gujarat riot victims, the Supreme Court stayed the arrest of Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand till February 19. β€There is no doubt in my mind that the persecution is because of the work they have done in bringing the guilty to book. It is our duty to see that the witch-hunt doesnβ€™t go on,β€ said noted documentary filmmaker Anand Patwardhan. The activists, who included Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, cited a number of criminal cases pursued by Ms. Setalvadβ€™s NGO in Gujarat, including the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots. . Pointing to a worrying trend for social activism under the Narendra Modi government, Mr. Gandhi said the state was sending the strong message that β€if you stand up for rights, honesty or ethics, you will be persecuted.β€ Mr. Gandhi also expressed concern over Ms. Setalvadβ€™s safety if she were to go into custody. Pointing to the hate campaign against Ms. Setalvad on social media, Mr. Gandhi said he faced a barrage of obscene response after he tweeted in her support β€Will the government ensure their safety? From the people who are in jail due to the efforts of Teesta and Anand? As we can see in Gujarat, the accused have been rewarded. How does the state ensure that it doesnβ€™t fall prey to such strong-arm tactics?β€

Dakshina Kannada Zilla Sahitya Parishad president Pradeep Kalkura has condoled the death of centenarian Maroli Narayana Rao at his house on Friday.

The Supreme Court on Monday said its decision to transfer the bail application of activist Teesta Setalvad in the Gulbarg society embezzlement case to a new Bench was prompted by the recusal of a judge. Supreme Court Registrar M. K. Hanjura told the media that news reports suggesting that the case was transferred from a Bench of Justices S. J. Mukhopadhaya and N.V. Ramana to that of Justices Dipak Misra and A.K. Goel at the behest of Chief Justice H.L. Dattu lacked β€basis or substance.β€ He stressed that the case came to Justice Dipak Misraβ€™s Bench after one of the judges in the Justice Mukhopadhaya Bench recused. He did not specify which of the two judges β€” Justice Mukhopadhaya or Justice Ramana β€” had sought recusal. β€Whatever has been done has been done at the direct recusal of one of the judges of the previous Bench,β€ Mr. Hanjura said. The decision to change the Bench came to light on the eve of the bail hearing when the Supreme Court posted its cause list on its official website. Justice Mukhopadhaya had granted Ms. Setalvad and her husband, Javed Anand, interim protection from arrest till February 19.

  John Dayal John Dayal, a well-known New Delhi-based journalist and human rights activist, has often been subjected to hostile attention from Hindutva forces but there has been a sharp spurt in the attacks via Twitter with the #ShameOnJohnDayal hashtag trending wildly of late. In a timely response, Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Womenβ€™s Association, and herself constantly targeted by Hindutva outfits whose members hurl racist and sexist abuse at her, has launched a petition addressed to the commissioner of police, Delhi, urging him to β€provide adequate and prompt protection to Dayal, and take immediate measures to identify and arrest all those making threats or indulging in hate speech against himβ€. Krishnanβ€™s petition notes that, β€Dayal, known for his committed struggle against communalism and bigotry and his defence of democracy and peace, is being subjected to an unrelenting hate campaign on social media. The trolls, all supporters of the Indian prime minister, the BJP and RSS, have even gone to the extent of making public his personal contact details β€“ thereby creating a clear and present danger for himβ€. Dayal is secretary-general of the All India Christian Council and is a former president of the All India Catholic Union. When I first learned of the latter role of his, perhaps while I was living and working in Hong Kong, my reaction was one of surprise that a person I knew to be a noted mainstream journalist had taken on a role representing a religious community. Iβ€™d have written him a note, saying, β€Hey John, whatβ€™s with this activism on behalf of a religious denomination?β€ Or words to that effect: But I had lost touch with him. The first Iβ€™d met John Dayal was in 1977 when he was chief reporter with the Patriot newspaper, one of numerous broadsheets edited and printed along the once glorious Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. Patriot was generally seen as pro-Soviet Union and pro-Communist Party of India (CPI). It was, however, a well-edited paper and Johnβ€™s position was not to be sniffed at. He and a colleague of his, Ajoy Bose, had by the autumn of 1977 written a book entitled For Reasons of State: Delhi Under Emergency. It narrated the atrocities meted out to people living in many impoverished parts of Delhi during Indira Gandhiβ€™s regime. I was interning at the Press Institute of India then and had been asked to interview Dayal and Bose and write for its quarterly publication, Vidura. There was a certain air of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein about the duoβ€™s book venture. The next I met John Dayal was in 1984 when we were contesting elections for the Delhi Union of Journalists, but on opposite sides, he with a centrist grouping and I with a broadly pro-left slate. I reconnected with him via social media several years ago, while still living in Hong Kong and eventually came round to the view that his work defending the rights of Christians and other minorities in India was vital for two reasons: first, the rights of those of us born in the so-called majority community in India and who regard ourselves to be irreligious or, to use what I deem to be synonymous terms (in a non-academic sense), sceptics, unbelievers, agnostics, atheists, rationalists, humanists and so forth, can only be protected if the right of all believers is. Moreover, a predominant majority of those deemed β€Hindusβ€ wish to live in peace with their neighbours in their slums, villages and tribal communities. Incidentally, atheism has been an integral part of ancient systems of Indian philosophy and the word Hindu, as currently used in India, is of foreign conception. Second, terms such as β€sickularβ€, β€pseudo-secularβ€, β€libtardsβ€ β€“ no doubt a response to β€Hindutva retardsβ€ and β€Moditardsβ€ β€“ and β€presstitutesβ€ have begun to gain currency to describe those among the β€majorityβ€ community protesting or writing against the increasing attacks on Muslims and Christians and against the rising β€saffronisationβ€ of the polity. And so the work of John Dayal and several other activists gains importance as they seek to defend and protect not only the rights of their own denominations but of other minorities and all of us who wish to see India remain secular, plural, inclusive and peaceful. Happily, I was able to meet him again in person early last year when the Indian Social Institute in Bangalore (a research, publication and training body run by Catholics) had organised a-day-long interaction session with the United Nations special rapporteur on religious freedom or belief, Heiner Bielefeldt. Dayal presided over the session which featured not only Christians of various denominations but also Muslims and Hindus who spoke about the rising menace of Hindutva fascism, albeit in a state currently ruled by a non-BJP regime. Karnatakaβ€™s current Congress party regime of chief minister Siddaramaiah has shown itself incapable of stemming the rising tide of attacks on Christians, Muslims and secular Hindus. A former vice-chancellor of Hampi University and rationalist scholar named MM Kalburgi was shot dead in his home in Dharwad, in northern Karnataka on August 30. Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare in Maharashtra had earlier met the same fates for the sin of being rationalists. A Mysore-based writer named KS Bhagwan has received a similar threat. In southern coastal Karnataka β€“ a hotbed of Hindutva attacks β€“ it is open season against Muslims and Christians with concocted allegations of β€love jihadβ€ being hurled at young couples. And so, it behoves on me, and on all of us who want this land to be peaceful and tolerant, to speak up for those who are attacked by Hindutva fascist forces. A 20th century German Protestant pastor named Martin Niemoeller is widely credited with having penned a poem which generally goes as follows, although there are myriad versions thereof: β€First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew. β€¦β€ Let it not be said that we did not speak up when they came for John Dayal, for Irom Sharmila, Soni Sori, Dayamani Barla, Teesta Setalvad, Javed Anand, Perumal Murugan, Shabnam Hashmi, Kavita Krishnan, Priya Pillai and others too many to name.

"NEW DELHI: The home ministry may order a CBI inquiry into alleged violation of various sections of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by the Indian arm of global NGO Greenpeace. An internal note to this effect, sources told ET, has been moved within the ministry. A CBI probe is being justified on the ground that there is a need to investigate the proceeds of bank accounts used by Greenpeace India, the circulation of money across various accounts and then allegedly parking them in fixed deposits. ET has learnt that there may be divergent views within the ministry on the nature of probe to be ordered as even financial investigative agencies can carry out such probes. A home ministry spokesman declined to elaborate on the matter. \It's too early to comment,\"" he told ET. On September 2, the home ministry had cancelled Greenpeace's FCRA registration citing alleged violations. \""We have taken steps against Greenpeace India for FCRA violations, but during inspections we also came across other loopholes, which can be probed further only by a competent investigative agency. Also, there is an alternate opinion that the NGO could be given another chance and asked to rectify them,\"" said an official familiar with the matter. In its licence cancellation order, the ministry recorded that a Greenpeace representative was called personally \""to explain the details of entries and transaction pertaining to source of FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) on August 19. However, instead of clarifying, the representative preferred to reply that they have already answered the queries at different forum\"". Meanwhile, in a relief for Greenpeace India, the Madras High Court on Wednesday granted an interim stay for eight weeks on the cancellation of the NGO's registration under FCRA. \""We are confident that we have a strong legal case to demonstrate that the MHA is acting without any justification,\"" said Vinuta Gopal, co-executive director of Greenpeace India. The home ministry said it will study the order and appeal against the same. If a CBI inquiry is instituted against Greenpeace, it will be the second such case of alleged FCRA violation entrusted to the probe agency. Earlier, the home ministry had ordered an inquiry into the affairs of Gujaratbased activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang Communications. CBI later registered an FIR against Setalvad and her husband and carried out raids.

"Dismissed Gujarat Cadre IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt today told the Supreme Court that he was victimised and targeted by the state government, whose strategy was to shoot the messenger for his bold speaking about the handling of law and order situation during the riots of 2002. \It is a clear case of victimisation. I am being victimised for being bold enough to say I was present in the meeting of February 27, 2002 and heard some words uttered by the then Chief Minister,\"" his counsel and senior advocate Indira Jaising submitted before a bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu and Arun Mishra. However, she said it is also a fact that his claim of being present in the meeting was denied by the then Police Commissioner of Ahmedabad, the DIG and one of the Bhatt's subordinates, who allegedly had accompanied him in his vehicle to the Chief Minister's office and later accused him of coercing him to sign a false affidavit. The senior advocate said only Bhatt's driver had stood by his statement that they had gone for the meeting. She said the Gujarat government was critical of Bhatt raising the claim of his presence in the meeting as late as 2011. Further, she said that other officers testified while he was deliberately not summoned by the Justice G T Nanavati Commission set by the state government to probe riots cases. However, the use of word \""deliberate\"" evoked sharp reaction from the bench, which said the Justice Nanavati was a judge of the apex court and it was for him to think whom to summon before the commission. Jaising corrected herself and said \""in his wisdom he did not summon him (Bhatt)\"". The bench commented \""this is the correct expression.\"" The submission on behalf of Bhatt will continue next week and after that Gujarat Government will get the opportunity to refute the allegations including that there have been a \""pattern\"" since 2002 to deal with the cases of riots by the state machinery. \""The strategy is to shoot the messenger so that he should not carry the informations and the problem will be over,\"" Jaising said while elaborating the manner in which the cases of riots and some encounter killings since 2002 were dealt with by the apex court and some of them shifted to neighbouring Maharashtra for fair and impartial criminal trials.Β  Jaising said the sacked IPS officer had not only complained about the leakage of information about the proceedings held before the apex court-appointed Special Investigating Team (SIT) to probe the nine cases of riots but was of the view that the hearing before it suffered from disquiet and inequity. Bhatt, who has filed fresh applications in the pending petitions, referred to the e-mail from the accounts of Tushar Mehta, the then Additional Advocate General of Gujarat, and alleged that instead of working on behalf of the state he was drafting petitions of the accused in the Gulbarg Society case and exchanging them with senior advocates Ram Jethmalani and Mahesh Jethmalani, who were representing the accused. Two persons targeted for speaking against administration were social activist Teesta Setalvad and Bhatt, she said. The bench said earlier the prayers in Bhatt's two petitions were to transfer two cases to CBI and now in the application he wants that instead of CBI those cases be handed over for apex court-monitored probe by the SIT. Jaising said Bhatt was not for quashing of FIRs but for fair and impartial probe and was ready to be hanged only after a fair probe which is incumbent in a democracy. She said SIT probe is needed today as the CBI is under the supervision of the Centre and the then CM has come to the Centre as Prime Minister and the then law officer of Gujarat has become Additional Solicitor General at the Centre. She said that the e-mail accounts of Mehta would show how the BJP chief, an RSS functionary and some bureaucrats were coming in the way of administration of justice in the riot cases and encounter cases. The apex court had yesterday commenced hearing on the pleas of Bhatt seeking apex court-monitored SIT probe into allegation of misuse of state machinery during 2002 post- Godhra riots and the alleged role of top BJP and RSS functionaries and some senior bureaucrats. The two petitions of 2011 relating to it and fresh applications filed on Monday will come up for hearing again on September 22. The IPS officer, dismissed from service on August 18 this year, had filed the petitions in the apex court in 2011 against the lodging of FIRs against him by the Gujarat Police. One of the petitions pertains to an FIR lodged by a Gujarat police constable K D Panth in Ahmedabad alleging that Bhatt had pressurised him to sign an affidavit testifying that the IPS officer had participated in a high-level meeting after the Godhra carnage. In another FIR, he has been accused of allegedly hacking then state's Additional Advocate General Tushar Mehta's e-mail account. Mehta is currently the Additional Solicitor General of India. In fresh applications, the sacked IPS officer had also sought to implead top BJP and RSS leaders and senior IAS officers alleging that they were part of a larger conspiracy to subvert the ends of justice. The apex court had earlier stayed criminal proceedings against the officer. He has sought fresh investigation against him in all cases with a plea for direction to internet service providers to preserve all data he has put in the applications."""
New Delhi: The government plans to streamline the audit and registration of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving foreign funding, and is expected to come out with a new set of guidelines in the next fortnight. Deliberations within the home ministry as to how processes for NGOs, particularly those receiving foreign funds, can be simplified are at an advanced stage. The aim of the exercise is to ensure greater disintermediation of processes so that there is minimal contact with the bureaucracy. The government has been severely criticized for allegedly targeting NGOs, specially the ones receiving foreign funds. According to a senior home ministry official, one of the key changes in the revised guidelines will be that NGOs that do not receive any foreign funding in a particular fiscal year will not be required to file a certified copy of the auditorsβ€™ report with the ministryβ€™s foreigners division. As of now, it is mandatory for every NGO, irrespective of whether or not they have received any foreign donations, to file the auditorsβ€™ report. Further, NGOs that receive foreign donations will be able allowed to file the auditorsβ€™ report online. Similarly, NGOs will be allowed to file their income-tax returns online; the ministry will not insist on a hard copy, the official said, on condition of anonymity. β€We had sought responses from all stakeholders as to how the functioning of NGOs could be made easier. Based on the feedback, we are going to make changes to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules (FCRR), 2011, under which NGOs receive foreign funds. We are going to cut down drastically on the paperwork required for registration of new NGOs and even renewal of licences. We are working on the fine print and will finalize it very soon,β€ the official said. β€Even the security checks done by multiple agencies at the time of registration or renewal of licence for a foreign-funded NGO will be cut down. As of now, various agencies at the central and state levels do this, but under the new arrangement, Intelligence Bureau will be the only nodal agency for the security clearance so that the process is expedited,β€ he added. The proposed amendments come in the wake of the home ministryβ€™s cancellation and suspension of licences, under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), of approximately 8,000 organizations, and recent court cases involving Greenpeace India and Teesta Setalvadβ€™s Sabrang Trust. β€We commend the reform process being brought about by the ministry,β€ said Arjun Phillip, spokesperson of Voluntary Action Network India (VANI), an NGO focused on promoting volunteerism and which also calls itself an umbrella organisation for not-for-profit organisations. β€Currently, the discussion or proposals for amendment of FCRR are pure speculation, as we have had no official intimation from the ministry. However, if the government does succeed in reducing complexities like the number of forms, physical copies of tax returns, etc., it will help NGOs,β€ he added. Cautioning against the ministryβ€™s aim to move applications and submissions online, Phillip said, β€As an advocacy network for grassroots organizations we feel everything moving online will be a challenge. There are many who have no access to regular or strong networks in far-flung areas of operations, so this is something the government must take into account when setting deadlines for submissions.β€ Most not-for-profit organizations are wary of commenting on the developments within the home ministryβ€™s foreigners division. As Venkatesh Nayak, programme coordinator at Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, said, β€In July, when the ministry published the draft amendment Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules, a number of submissions were made from civil society organizations. Currently, we do not know what has been accepted, rejected or modified, and therefore cannot comment.β€ He added that civil society organizations that have been witnessing greater scrutiny over the past year have been at the receiving end of the arbitrary use of the FCRA. β€Time and again, whenever the Act has been used to either freeze organizationsβ€™ bank accounts or cancel their registration for receipt of funds from abroad, the courts have decided in favour of the organizations, the latest instance being the stay on FCRA licence cancellation of Greenpeace India by the Madras high court,β€ he said.
The international donor agency Ford Foundation, under government watch for funding NGOs of Teesta Setalvad, agreed to a key demand of the Union home ministry for its smooth operations in India, applying for registration under the Indian law. β€We have recently submitted, at the (Indian) governmentβ€™s direction, an application for registration under applicable Indian law,β€ said the foundation in a statement e-mailed to HT. According to ministry officials, all liaison offices of international donor agencies need to register under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema). Since the foundation had not done so, it was asked to register. To make it easier for the foundation to work in India, the ministry also allowed it bring in US $1,50,000 per month as administrative expenses. In April, the ministry put the agency on its watch-list for funding Setalvadβ€™s NGOs, saying they didnβ€™t use the foundation money for the stated purpose, a violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. Setalvad, a vocal critic of PM Narendra Modi, denied the charge but the home ministry asked the CBI to probe further. The foundation has said it has provided β€complete informationβ€™ on funding to Teestaβ€™s NGOs β€as requested by the government agenciesβ€™. According to the foundation, grants recommended by its India office are paid from the foundationβ€™s headquarters in New York. The critical role of India office is to understand local context, work with local partners, and identify needs and opportunities within each unique region.

"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is likely to probe the case of alleged violation of various sections of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) by the Indian arm of global NGO Greenpeace. The Home Ministry has approached CBI to set an inquiry against the NGO. There may be divergent views within the ministry on the nature of probe to be ordered as even financial investigative agencies can carry out such probes. However, it is reportedly said that the CBI probe is being justified on the ground that there is a need to investigate the proceeds of bank accounts used by Greenpeace India. There is also a need to probe about the circulation of money across various accounts and then allegedly parking them in fixed deposits. The Home Ministry on September 2 had cancelled Greenpeace's FCRA registration citing alleged violations. \We have taken steps against Greenpeace India for FCRA violations, but during inspections we also came across other loopholes, which can be probed further only by a competent investigative agency. Also, there is an alternate opinion that the NGO could be given another chance and asked to rectify them,\"" said an official familiar with the matter. Moreover, in its licence cancellation order, the ministry recorded that a Greenpeace representative was called personally \""to explain the details of entries and transaction pertaining to source of FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) on August 19. However, instead of clarifying, the representative preferred to reply that they have already answered the queries at different forum\"". On Wednesday, the Madras High Court granted an interim stay for eight weeks on the cancellation of the NGO's registration under FCRA. \""We are confident that we have a strong legal case to demonstrate that the MHA is acting without any justification,\"" said Vinuta Gopal, co-executive director of Greenpeace India. The home ministry said it will study the order and appeal against the same. If a CBI inquiry is instituted against Greenpeace, it will be the second such case of alleged FCRA violation entrusted to the probe agency. Earlier, the Home Ministry had ordered an inquiry into the affairs of Gujarat-based activist Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang Communications. CBI later registered an FIR against Setalvad and her husband and carried out raids. Greenpeace India has been charged with transfer of funds from its designated FCRA accounts to other accounts and underreporting of receipts of overseas funding. (Image: Indiatimes)"""
"NEW DELHI: Doubting the fairness of the probe into FIRs against him, dismissed Gujarat IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt on Thursday requested the Supreme Court to substitute his plea for a CBI probe with a Special Investigation Team probe, alleging that the agency's sharpness appeared blunted after then CM Narendra Modi became prime minister. Senior advocate Indira Jaising said Bhatt was being victimized and harassed with two FIRs solely because he had dared to testify that he was present in a high-level meeting at the then CM's residence on February 27, 2002 to take stock of post-Godhra violence in which Bhatt claimed Modi had allegedly asked the police to go slow against the frenzied mob. Though the meeting took place in 2002, Bhatt first mentioned Modi's alleged utterances seven years later in 2009 in an affidavit in the case brought before the SC by Jakia Jafri, who had claimed that Modi, his cabinet colleagues, police and bureaucrats should be punished for deliberate abdication of their constitutional duty to protect citizens. The SIT had given a clean chit to Modi but amicus curiae in the case Raju Ramachandran had said whether Bhatt was present in the crucial meeting or not was a matter to be examined by a trial court. Finding Bhatt raking up the old case, Teesta Setalvad-led NGO 'Citizens for Justice and Peace' and Jakia Jafri moved a joint application seeking to be a party in the case in the SC. However, their application could not be taken up for hearing by a bench of Chief Justice H L Dattu and Arun Mishra on Thursday. Of the two FIRs against Bhatt, one accused him of pressurizing his subordinate policeman to give false evidence about his presence in the February 27, 2002 meeting and the other was lodged by former additional advocate general Tushar Mehta accusing Bhatt of hacking his email account. Narrating the sequence of the high voltage monitoring of probe into 2002 riot cases by the SC, Jaising said two cases - Best Bakery and Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter -- were transferred out of Gujarat to Maharashtra as the state police probe failed to inspire confidence. Bhatt's counsel said after Modi became prime minister, the CBI decided not to file appeal against BJP chief Amit Shah's acquittal in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case though it involved triple murder. Jaising drew a parallel between the FIRs against Bhatt with the changed approach of CBI after Modi became PM and said her client now had no faith in the agency carrying out a fair probe into the root cause behind lodging of cases against him - his steadfastness in maintaining that the then CM had \uttered certain words\"" which hindered the state police from reacting quickly to the situation that was slipping out of control. Echoing Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's 'maut ka saudagar' jibe at Modi during the 2007 state election campaign in which Congress suffered a massive defeat, Jaising said the justice delivery system was systematically stifled because of the collusion between the prosecution and accused during Modi's reign, which was \""an era marked by riots and killings\"". After patiently hearing arguments on applications for more than an hour, Justices Dattu and Mishra wondered why such a long backgrounder was given to a simple case. \""Here, one policeman made a complaint against another officer that he was forcing him to give false evidence and nothing beyond that. Other (riot) cases had more things in it.\"" Though Jaising touched upon the contents of both FIRs in detail, she said senior advocate Rajeev Dhawan would argue for Bhatt on the second FIR. The hearing was adjourned to Tuesday."""
"NEW DELHI: Two contracts signed between the Ford Foundation and Teesta Setalvad's Sabrang Communications in 2004 and 2006 have come under the scanner of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that's probing alleged foreign contribution violations in this regard. CBI registered a case against Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand in July, soon after which raids were carried out that are said to have led to the disclosure of these contracts. According to CBI, the documents hold the key to work done by Sabrang Communications in Gujarat and Maharashtra from 2004 to 2009. Setalvad received $290,000 from US-based Ford Foundation without getting clearance from the home ministry, the agency has alleged. As per the agreement reviewed by ET, the task assigned to Setalvad by the Ford Foundation included the monitoring of media besides reviewing and initiating discussions on judicial decisions. The agreements of April 5, 2004, and 22 September, 2006, were signed by Anand on behalf of Sabrang and Ganeshan Balachandran of Ford Foundation. The agreements included the following terms: Sabrang Communication agreed that no funds will be used to conduct any activities in US, not even for travel purposes. Activities will include organising public meetings on a regular basis for the minority community. Educate lawyer associationsthrough a series of meetings on the issues of criminal law and its use and misuse. Promote media advocacy to be sensitive to the issues of minorities. Initiate public hearings, advocacy, review of judicial decisions as a part of a long-drawn campaign for minority rights. Counteract adverse propaganda by creating strong civil society voices for engendering peace and changing the public discourse. Prepare a detailed media monitor on rights violations including communal and caste discrimination. Refusing to elaborate on the investigations, a CBI pokesperson said, \Whatever names are there in the FIR (first information report) are being examined by CBI.\"" In an e-mail reply, Setalvad said, \""The consultancy agreement was signed by Sabrang Communications only after advice from eminent legal counsel that such an agreement was covered under the exclusion stipulated under Section 4 of the Act and therefore the consultancy fees (not grant or donation) received would not be in violation of FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) 2010.\"" She also said the government was targeting the organisation and its leaders for their role in pursuing justice for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots. A Ford Foundation spokesperson told ET: \""The foundation entered into contractual arrangements with Sabrang Communications in 2004 and 2006 to provide data and support to organisations working to build communal harmony in India... The foundation has provided complete information on these funds as requested by government agencies.\"""""
NEWΒ DELHI: As many as 63 years after it first started operations in India on the invitation of former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Ford Foundation has decided to work under Indian laws in the wake of the recent crackdown by the Modi government against its activities in the country. Sources said the New York -headquartered international donor agency recently held several consultations with top government officials after the Home Ministryβ€™s April directive to put it on the watch list, in national interest and for the security of the country. The NDA government is understood to have told the foundation to register its activities in India under Indian rules and regulations applicable to other donors. The government action had come after it noticed that the Ford Foundation had released grants to Sabrang Communication, a private limited company run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, which was not registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. In response to questions by Express, Joshua Cinelli, Ford Foundationβ€™s media relations chief, said, β€We have submitted an application to have our Delhi office registered as a branch office.β€ This is a major climb down from Ford Foundationβ€™s earlier stand when it had told the then Nehru-headed government to β€Take it or Leave itβ€™ while refusing to register under Indian laws. Although concerns were raised during the Nehru regime, about bringing Ford Foundation under the law of the land, such suggestions were rejected by the political leadership of the country. For 63 years, Ford Foundation had been operating in India under a Memorandum of Agreement with the government. Cinelli said that grants recommended by the Ford Foundationβ€™s India office are paid from its headquarters in New York, and this is generally the case for its other regional offices as well. β€The critical role of the office in New Delhi β€“ as with all our regional offices β€“ is to understand local context, work with local partners, and identify needs and opportunities within each unique region.Β  This is a central feature of how the Ford Foundation has worked for more than 60 years,β€ Cinelli told Express. Now, after the recent crackdown which puts it under β€the prior permission listβ€, and in the backdrop of ongoing probe into its funding, the foundation has also provided complete information on funds granted to Sabrang Communication after agencies sought a clarification.Ford Foundation admitted that it entered into contractual arrangements with Sabrang Communications in 2004 and 2006, and in 2009, provided a grant to the Sabrang Trust. The Gujarat government, had earlier this year, accused Ford Foundation of interfering in the countryβ€™s internal affairs. β€How a grant of $2,90,000 was given to a private limited company by Ford Foundation to address communalism and caste-based discrimination in India etc...including for β€media strategiesβ€™ is a subject matter of investigation,β€ the Gujarat government had told the Home Ministry, seeking further investigation.
 Published:July 9, 2015 4:50 am According to the Home Ministry, SCPPL received foreign contribution of $290,000 and Rs 1,30,97,153 in violation of Section 4 (1) (b) of FCRA, 1976, and Section 3 (1) (b) of FCRA, 2010. The CBI on Wednesday registered a case against activist Teesta Setalvad as well as her husband Javed Anand and Peshimam Gulam Mohammed, both directors of Mumbai-based Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL) on β€allegations of criminal conspiracy for illegal acceptance of foreign contributions without registration and prior permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs.β€ The case was filed under IPC sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy and sections of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 2010, and FCRA, 1976, the CBI said. According to the Home Ministry, SCPPL received foreign contribution of $290,000 and Rs 1,30,97,153 in violation of Section 4 (1) (b) of FCRA, 1976, and Section 3 (1) (b) of FCRA, 2010.  Setalvad, who was at the forefront of the campaign for 2002 Gujarat riot victims, told PTI, β€We are only responding to media reports which are following leakage from the government side. We have got nothing from the CBI. While we maintain that no rules were violated, we still suo motu wrote a letter to the CBI on June 30 assuring them full cooperation and stating that we were willing to cooperate in any investigations. We also told them to give us a notice to furnish any documents they require.β€ Instructing the CBI to probe the alleged FCRA violations by SCPPL, the Home Ministry had last month stated that an inspection of the accounts and records of company was carried out from June 8 to June 10 for the period 2006-7 to 2014-15. It was reportedly found that SCPPL is a private limited company engaged in publication, which is not entrusted to receive foreign contributions in any circumstances. If the company thought otherwise, it could have applied for permission before accepting foreign contribution, and by not doing so it violated Section 11 of FCRA, 2010, the ministry said.  
 Updated: July 14, 2015 12:58 pm Social activist Teesta Setalvad The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing allegations of embezzlement against civil rights activist Teesta Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand and businessman Gulam Mohammed Peshimam and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) has carried out raids at the office and the residence of the activist in Mumbai on Tuesday.  Confirming the development CBI spokesperson told The Indian Express that the raids are underway at the office and the residential premises of the activists in Mumbai. Sources say searches would also be carried out in Gujarat and Delhi. On July 7 the agency registered a case against the activist for allegedly receiving funds from foreign entities without prior permission or intimation from the government. The case has been registered under certain sections of the Foreign Contributions (Regulation) Act (FCRA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Sources say that the activist and her husband are likely to be questioned during the searches. According to sources, the Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) ( both run by Teesta and her husband) allegedly received foreign funds. The said amount were diverted to SCPPL. The FIR was lodged after the Home Ministry found alleged discrepancies by the two NGOs under FCRA. The probe by Home Ministry was under taken after a letter sent by the Gujarat government detailing out irregularities on the part of the NGOs run by Teesta and requesting for a thorough probe. Teesta has been fighting the battle for the victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots.  
 Updated: July 15, 2015 7:55 am Setalvad at her home, Tuesday. (express photo by: Amit Chakravarty) A 12-member team of the CBI carried out raids Tuesday at the Mumbai home and office of activist Teesta Setalvad in connection with allegations of illegally accepting foreign funds. The agency, which raided three locations, is probingΒ allegations of embezzlement against Setalvad; her husband Javed Anand; businessman Gulam Mohammed Peshimam; and Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd. On July 7, the CBI had registered a case against Setalvad for allegedly receiving funds from foreign entities without taking permission from the Central government. The case was registered under sections of the Foreign Contributions (Regulation) Act (FCRA) and the Indian Penal Code.  β€The (CBI action) is shameful political vendetta,β€ said Setalvad who has been a prime mover in many cases against authorities in Gujarat linked to the 2002 riots. Referring to these cases today, she said in a statement: β€The Zakia Jafri case begins its final hearings on July 27. The Naroda Patiya appeals (Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi) are being heard in the Gujarat High Court tomorrow. This is nothing but a bid to subvert the cause of public justice and ensure that no justice happens in these cases.β€ Sources in the agency said similar raids would be conducted in Gujarat and Delhi and added that the activist and her husband are likely to be questioned. The probe by the Home Ministry came after the Gujarat government sent a letter detailing alleged irregularities by NGOs run by Setalvad. Sources said the two NGOs under scrutiny for allegedly receiving foreign funds are the Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace, both run by Teesta and her husband. β€We had written to the CBI offering full cooperation. The so-called offences relate to documentary evidence. This search is nothing but an attempt to intimidate and humiliate. India should be ashamed that when scams like Vyapam are happening, over 50 persons dying, witnesses in Asaram Bapu case are dying, CBI is not appealing in critical cases related to crimes by politicians. The agency is being unleashed on human rights defenders standing up for the rights of survivors of mass violence. It is worse than the British Raj. Pathetic,β€ Setalvad said. CBI spokesperson Kanchan Prasad said the searches were being conducted after following due process. It was alleged that Sabrang violated FCRA by accepting a donation of $2.9 lakh from US-based Ford Foundation without getting clearance from the Home Ministry. The state police have also accused Setalvad of embezzling funds meant for a memorial for the riot victims. She has denied these allegations.

The opposition leaders said it was β€not a coincidenceβ€ that the raid took place just a day before the appeal of Maya Kodnani and Babu Bajrangi in the Naroda Patiya case was to be heard in the Gujarat High Court, and a week before the Zakiya Jafri case was scheduled to come up before the Supreme Court. They pointed out that Setalvad was set to appear in both the cases.

 Updated: July 23, 2015 10:13 am Social activist Teesta Setalvad. Seeking permissionΒ for arrest and custodial interrogation of social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, the Gujarat police has requested the Supreme Court to modify its order on protecting the couple from arrest so that the full extent of their β€crimes against charity can be unearthed.β€ In an additional affidavit filed in response to an anticipatory bail plea moved by Teesta and her husband, the police contended that the couple committed β€colossal fraudβ€ and β€dishonestly misappropriatedβ€ funds meant for the 2002 Gujarat riots victims. Teestaβ€™s petition is likely to come up for hearing before a three-judge bench on August 10. A two-judge bench had in March referred the bail plea to a larger bench while extending protection from arrest to the couple.  The police have claimed that the money, collected for constructing a memorial for the riots victims and for their aid, was spent by the couple for personal expenses ranging from wine and liquor, expensive mobile phones, movie CDs, romantic novels, hair-styling, dining etc. The police said Setalvad and Anand as trustees of two trusts β€” Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) β€” have by β€diverse methodsβ€ allegedly β€misappropriated the funds of charity and converted to their own use funds meant for the rehabilitation and welfare of the unfortunate victims of riots in Gujarat in Feb-March 2002β€. It said the probe into the case of alleged embezzlement of funds for a museum at Gulbarg Society, devastated in the 2002 riots, revealed that expenses of β€very personal natureβ€ have been debited by them under the heads β€Secular Educationβ€ and β€Legal Aid Expensesβ€. The investigation revealed that Setalvad claimed reimbursement towards purchase of sanitary napkins in the name of medical expense and β€surprisinglyβ€ her husband too claimed reimbursement for it, as per the affidavit. The affidavit said 45 per cent of total funds received by Sabrang Trust in 2008-13 have gone to Setalvad and her husband either directly or through Sabrang Communications Pvt Limited (SCPPL), which was fully owned by them. The affidavit stated that Teesta drew a salary of Rs 8.75 lakh and that she flew 113 times in a year. β€The inescapable conclusion is that the entire amount paid by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL has been siphoned by petitioner under the guise of cash withdrawal and cheque payments. SCPPL is a vehicle used by the petitioners for the purpose of siphoning donations to the Sabrang Trust,β€ it said.

Confirming the move, a home ministry official said, β€CJP will now require prior approval from the foreigners division of the MHA before it can accept or use any foreign contribution.β€ The CJP is alleged to have violated various provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).  According to the MHA, although the CJP was registered for β€educational and economicβ€ purposes, it had received foreign contribution for activities such as β€legal aidβ€ that falls under the β€socialβ€ purpose. This constituted a violation of FCRA rules, said the MHA. The CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of the 2002 Gujarat riots, and Sabarang Trust, run by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, were issued notices by the MHA about two months ago. According to the MHA, inspection of records and books of accounts of the two NGOs allegedly revealed β€irregularities and financial misappropriationβ€. In their replies, the two NGOs said they were not guilty of any financial irregularities and that no foreign contribution was misused by any office bearer. The MHA had inspected the accounts of the two NGOs in April following a request from the Gujarat government.  
 Published:July 24, 2015 6:54 pm Social activist Teesta Setalvad Social activist Teesta Setalvad, accused of embezzling funds meant for victims of the Gulberg Housing Society, today rebutted the charges made by Gujarat Police that she and her husband had misappropriated the funds for personal expenses. The statement by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, who are trustees of the two NGOs in question, Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) and Sabrang Trust, issued here said the funds raised for the construction of a memorial at Gulberg Society massacre site were still lying unutilised.  β€Since we, Sabrang Trust only managed to raise Rs 4.6 lakh, we had to inform the Society (members of Gulberg society) that the Memorial project was not feasible,β€ theΒ statement said. β€No contract was ever signed, no property or deed ever changed hands, no rent was promised nor monies changed hands. The Rs 4.6 lakh donated by individuals (all Indians, including one NRI) are still unutilised,β€ it claimed. The statement was issued by Setalvad after Gujarat police filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court. Opposing the the anticipatory bail plea of Setalvad in the apext court, the state police had alleged that the duo had misappropriated funds that was meant for building a museum at Gulberg Society massacre site, for personal expenses ranging from wine, ear-buds to expensive mobile phone. In the affidavit, the police had said that Setalvad and Anand as trustees of the two trusts β€” Sabrang Trust and Citizen for Justice and Peace (CJP) β€” have by β€diverse methodsβ€ allegedly β€misappropriated funds of charity and converted to their own use funds ment for rehabilitation of riot victimsβ€. Refuting the allegations, the activist today said CJP raised money for providing legal aid to victims and its record in this respect is β€unprecedentedβ€ in India. β€Witness protection and probity during the trial despite hostile regimes have ensured the convictions of 120 persons,β€ their statement said. β€All payments to Teesta or Javed were strictly in accordance with the budgets proposed to and accepted by Ford Foundation, UNVFVT (United Nations Voluntarily Fund for Victims of Torture), CRY,β€ the statement said on Gujarat Policeβ€™s claims that salaries of Setalvad and her husband started increasing exponentially every year. The Gujarat Police had alleged that 45 per cent of total funds received by Sabrang Trust between 2008 and 2013 have gone to Setalvad and her husband either directly or through Sabrang Communication Pvt Ltd (SCPPL), which was fully owned by them. Refuting the charge, the statement said, β€All payments by CJP and ST (Sabrang Trust) towards reimbursements for shared expenses were as per resolutions passed from time to time by their respective trustees.β€ β€Teesta and Javed recused themselves from the decisions taken in all such instances,β€ the statement added. β€Sabrang Communication made no profit from the expenses sharing arrangement and Teesta and Javed were not paid even a rupee out of such reimbursements,β€ it claimed.  
 Updated: July 25, 2015 11:44 am Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand outside a court in Mumbai Friday. (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar) The Bombay High Court Friday gave activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand interim relief from arrest for two weeks β€” hours after a special CBI court rejected their anticipatory bail plea. Setalvad and her husband were apprehending arrest by the Economic Offences Wing of the CBI on allegations of embezzlement. Quick to respond to the CBI courtβ€™s order, Setalvadβ€™s lawyers filed an application in high court and mentioned it before Justice Mridula Bhatkar at 3 pm. In high court, the Centre told the judiciary that the nature of allegations against Setalvad and her husband was such that it could β€affect the Indian economyβ€.  Appearing for the activist, advocate Mihir Desai informed the court that Teesta and her husband had been booked under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) for allegedly collecting foreign funds. Desai said that the government claimed its permission was not taken for carrying out the foreign transaction, but argued that permission was not required in the first place. β€We had taken written opinion of a senior counsel of this high court (on whether or not to take government approval),β€ said Desai. The CBI, through public prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, objected to the pre-arrest bail plea, saying that the nature of the allegations was β€very seriousβ€. He argued that the case could affect the countryβ€™s economy since the secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Foreigners Division (FCRA wing), was the complainant. When Justice Bhatkar observed that two weeks could be given, Shinde objected and said that the relief should be for one week less. However, the HC decided that Setalvad and her husband should not be arrested for two weeks. The HC also observed that the accused did not need to be questioned daily, and directed them to go on July 27 and 30 and then on August 3 and 6 till the next hearing comes up on August 10. Earlier in the day, when the special CBI court rejected Setalvad and her husbandβ€™s anticipatory bail application, she lashed out at the special judge, saying that she was β€shocked and aggrieved by the judgementβ€ and she believed that β€it is done to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by powers in Delhiβ€. The court reprimanded her and said she was committing contempt of court by speaking about the order, especially when she has appointed a lawyer on her behalf. β€Being an individual, I am constrained to accept the order and am sharing my views. My sympathisers feel that it is done to intimidate me and possibly eliminate me. We have had other applications accepted in petty offences,β€ she responded. The CBI, on July 8, registered a case against Setalvad and her husband and raided their home and offices a week later. The agency is probing whether Setalvadβ€™s NGO Sabrang received funding from the US-based Ford Foundation without government permission. The case has been registered under certain sections of the FCRA and the IPC. The special court observed that β€prima facie, a case was made out against herβ€. The court has also maintained that the case was based on documentary evidence, which is required to be seized from the possession of the accused. β€Custodial interrogation of the accused is necessary,β€ the special judge further observed. Around five people had accompanied Setalvad and her husband to the special court. As she left the court, they formed a circle around her to β€protectβ€ her. In the high court, the CBI said Setalvadβ€™s application for relief was not maintainable. β€Because of the application, we are unable to arrest the accused and they get to escape,β€ special public prosecutor for CBI Anil Singh said. It is alleged that the Sabrang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace β€” both run by Setalvad and her husband β€” received foreign funds and the amount was diverted to Sabrang Communications and Publishing Pvt Ltd. The FIR was lodged after the Home Ministry found alleged discrepancies by the two NGOs under the FCRA. Β   
 Published:July 28, 2015 12:56 am SIT lawyer RS Jamuar requested the court to conduct the matter on a daily basis from August 4. The court replied it would consider on the next date. The Gujarat High Court on Monday adjourned the hearing of a petition challenging the clean chit given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others in the 2002 riots case till August 4, when it will decide whether the plea can be heard on a daily basis. The prayer was made by the lawyers representing the Supreme Court-appointment Special Investigation Team. The hearing was adjourned after petitioner Zakia Jafriβ€™s lawyer MM Tirmizi sought time for submitting additional documents. The move was objected by the SIT lawyers, stating that the court should not allow submission of any additional documents since all relevant materials in the case have already been given to the petitioner.  Justice Sonia Gokani asked Tirmizi that what additional documents he wants to submit as the case pertains to revision of a lower courtβ€™s order and she will rely only the documents which are part of the court. Tirmizi replied his senior counsel wants to prepare a chart to brief the court about the facts of the case in a nutshell. On July 24, Tirmizi had moved an application before the HC registrar seeking more time to submit additional documents. In the application, he had mentioned that due to a CBI raid on activist Teesta Setalvad, β€it was a bit difficult for the lawyers to prepare a charts and other additional documentsβ€. Justice Gokani, during the brief arguments, asked Tirmizi about the details of the CBI raid on Setalvad. When the application was objected by the SIT lawyers, Tirmizi told the court that he didnβ€™t want to press for the application. Following this, the court disposed of the application and adjourned the hearing till August 4. SIT lawyer RS Jamuar requested the court to conduct the matter on a daily basis from August 4. The court replied it would consider on the next date. Zakia Jafri, whose husband ex Congress MP Ahsan Jafri was among 69 persons killed in the Gulberg Society massacre during 2002 riots, moved this petition last year, challenging the order of a magisterial court that upheld the closure report filed by the SIT in 2012, giving a clean chit to Modi, who was the then chief minister, and 58 others.

A bench headed by Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya gave time to Teestaβ€™s counsel - former union minister and lawyer Kapil Sibal to file additional documents as he sought time to counter the allegations of cheating, misappropriation and breach of trust. The bench clarified it to Sibal that he would have to explain the allegations since the court would hear him only on the aspect of anticipatory bail and would not treat it as an appeal to quash the FIR. The bench asked Sibal not to give it a β€political dimensionβ€ after the senior lawyer claimed that Teesta and her husband were being hounded for taking up fight against a state (Gujarat) ruled by the BJP. On Thursday, the apex court had stayed Setalvad and her husbandβ€™s arrest by a bench headed by Chief Justice of India, H.L. Dattu. He passed the order after Sibal argued that the β€mightyβ€ Gujarat police is hell bent on arresting her. Dattuβ€™s directive came hours after the Gujarat High Court rejected the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Setalvad, her husband Javed Anand, Tanvir Jafri (son of Ehsan Jafri, former Congress MP who was killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots) and Firoz Gulzar, a resident of Gulberg Society here, in the case. A team of police reached at Teestaβ€™s house in Mumbai after the Gujarat High Court turned down her anticipatory bail plea. They are accused of misusing funds to the tune of Rs 1.51 crore meant for the families of Gulberg Society riot victims in 2002. There was a plan to build a museum for their memory, which was cancelled later. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, who appeared for the prosecution, had put forward statements of Setalvadβ€™s former accountant Rais Khan who claimed that she along with others misused the funds. On January 2014, the crime branch had registered a first information report against her and others for allegedly usurping the money. Twelve residents of the Society had alleged that Setalvad embezzled the funds and lodged complaint. Then, 69 people, including Ehsan Jafri, were killed in a mobβ€™s attack on the society on February 28, 2002, following the Godhra train burning incident.

The Supreme Court on Monday stepped into the row over the transfer of activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s anticipatory bail plea to a new bench, saying it was done after one of the judges of the previous bench recused from the case. Referring to news reports that Chief Justice of India H L Dattu had transferred Setalvadβ€™s plea to a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra despite the fact that neither of the judges of the previous bench, justices S J Mukhopadhya and N V Ramana, had recused, an apex court registrar said it has β€no basis or substanceβ€.

A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra, which had reserved its order on Setalvad's plea exactly a month ago, said that the larger bench will have to consider as to whether a person can be granted anticipatory bail when issues like liberty and fair and effective probe are to be decided simultaneously. SC frames guidelines on co-op society members removal The Supreme Court on Thursday laid down a slew of guidelines on removal of an office bearer in a cooperative society including that a motion of no confidence against a person \shall\"" be moved only after two years of his assuming the office.

US-based Ford Foundation has funded a political party and profit making organisations β€illegallyβ€ which has resulted in the foreign outfit coming under the Home Ministry scanner and put on the β€watch listβ€. A senior Home Ministry official said an investigation has found that funds sanctioned by the Ford Foundation to an NGO have reached a political party which automatically makes the donor liable to face action. But the Ford Foundation has rejected the charge. The probe has also found that Ford Foundation has funded several organisations which do not fall in the category of NGOs, which are eligible for receiving foreign funds, as they make profits, the official said. The international donor strongly refuted the charge of funding political parties but accepted that it worked with various entities including those which work for profits. β€We wish to affirm that the foundation does not fund political parties. The foundation does, however, work with a range of other entities, including non-governmental organisations, government and quasi-government entities, universities, and for-profit entities, depending on the needs of the particular work involved. β€This includes engaging for-profit entities to provide services to the foundation and its grantee communities,β€ Ford Foundation spokesperson Joshua Cinelli told a news agency in a statement.

The apex courtβ€™s Bar on Wednesday strongly backed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) and sharply attacked the collegium system which produced judges who give relief to film stars and politicians while the victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the 2002 Gujarat riots await justice. Referring to cases related to these two riots, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President and senior advocate Dushyant Dave told a five-judge bench headed by Justice J S Khehar that common man and the victims of violations of human rights have not been given justice. β€Itβ€™s a shame on us that we have not delivered justice to cases related to violations of human values and human rights,β€ the bench, also comprising justices J Chelameswar, M B Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh Kumar Goel said. At one stage during arguments, he said persons like Maya Kodnani, a former Guajarat minister convicted in a riots case, are getting relief on one hand and on the other hand, activist Teesta Setalvad had to run from pillar to post to get anticipatory bail, he said. The Bar leader gave several recent instances without naming the persons where a convicted politician and two Bollywood stars got relief from the Supreme Court and two different High Courts respectively. β€Why film stars and politicians get instant relief from courts and the common man suffers for years,β€ Dave raised a question and answered himself,β€It is because of bad judges.β€ Dave asked the judges to β€wear burqaβ€ and walk on courtβ€™s corridor to have a first-hand account ofΒ  the status of the judicial system. β€You cannot have ideal humans across the board,β€ the bench said and asked the SCBA president to suggest remedial measures to improve the system. β€You have given us enough β€lectureβ€™. Why donβ€™t you give suggestions to improve. You must give a remedial situation. You just want to react but donβ€™t want to suggest anything. Dave was upset at the word β€lectureβ€ used by the bench and said that he spoke from the heart and did not intend to hurt the sentiments of the judiciary. β€I felt hurt as my Lord characterised my argument as lecture. What I spoke came from my heart. I still say majority of judges are outstanding and a minority is bad,β€ Dave said. β€There are many things spoken from heart. You paint all of the judges with the same brush. We understand the agony and spirit but we want remedy. You can think over it and tell us,β€ the bench said.Β  At the outset, Dave referred to various Constitutional provisions related to appointment of judges in trial courts and higher judiciary and said that constitutional framers have rejected the primacy of judiciary after debating the issue in the Constituent Assembly. The 1993 judgement turned the Constitutional scheme β€upside downβ€, he said adding β€how can your Lordship read into words which were not there at all...the Constitution cannot be tinkered with in this fashion. β€You cannot add a word in a Constitution which was not there and it is not that the issue was not debated in the Constituent Assembly. It was debated and rejectedβ€. Finding fault with the 1993 verdict that had paved the way for the collegium system, he said,β€I dare say that the judgement did not refer to any Constituent Assembly debate and previous judgementsβ€. On the issue of nomination of two eminent persons in the NJAC, Dave said that the executive, the Parliament and the judiciary are well represented in the panel which would select them. β€What more can be there to ensure that the process is safeguarded,β€ he said adding that the objections raised by petitioners including Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAORA) are mere β€apprehensionsβ€. β€There is every reason to believe that two eminent persons would be nominated by an unanimous choice,β€ he said and added that even the court can say that there has to be collective decision.
Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notice by the Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and asked to reply within 15 days. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notice two days ago, following an on-site inspection of records and books of accounts carried out by Home Ministry officials in April this year. Sources said during the probe it was found that they were running a magazine β€Communalism Combatβ€™ as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under the FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for β€Educational and Economicβ€™ purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as β€Legal Aidβ€™ which is covered under purpose β€Socialβ€™. Hence, it violated the provisions of the FCRA rules, they contended. On review of vouchers of the association it was found that Sabrang Trust have made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand.
Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs - Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch last year, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society to 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10. They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case.Β 
Opposing activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anandβ€™s anticipatory bail applications, the CBI told a special court that the motive behind the transfer of foreign funds to a publishing house run by them reflected interference towards the internal security of India. Seeking the coupleβ€™s custodial interrogation, the agency said: β€Such an act of a foreign donor would prejudicially affect the strategic, scientific and economic interests of the state and the harmony between religions, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities.β€ Refuting their claims that as directors of Sabrang Communications and Publishing, they had not received any funding, the CBI alleged that US$2,90,000 was received and utilized by them in violation of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. While granting them interim relief until Tuesday, special judge A A Khan said the presence of Setalvad and Anand will be required when the orders are passed that day. Setalvad and Anand had filed the pleas though their advocate Vijay Hiremath in the aftermath of the searches carried at four places, including her Juhu residence and office of Sabrang Communications and Publishing.Β  The raid was conducted in connection with a case filed against Setalvad in Gujarat where she is accused of appropriating funds collected for her NGO, which was helping victims of theΒ  communal riots. Advocate Mihir Desai, who argued on the coupleβ€™s behalf, said they had been cooperating with the probe and that there was nothing concrete in the reasons mentioned by the CBI to detain them.Β 
"In a breather to social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband, the Bombay High Court today granted the duo 17-day interim relief from arrest in a CBI case alleging that her company received Rs 1.8 crore from abroad without mandatory approval from Centre. Justice Mridula Bhatkar, while granting Teesta and her husband Javed Anand interim protection from arrest till August 10, said the duo was already given protection by the sessions court. Teesta and Anand moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail after a special CBI court today rejected their pre-arrest bail pleas and also refused to extend the interim relief granted to them earlier on July 17. \At this stage I do not want to go into merits. Is there any chance of the accused persons absconding? If no, then interim protection can be granted for a period of two weeks,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. The court directed Teesta and her husband to appear before the office of Economic Offences Wing of CBI on July 27 and 30 and on August 3 and 6 for recording their statement from 12pm to 3pm. The court refused to agree to the CBI's demand to direct the duo to appear before the agency everyday. \""They (Teesta and Javed) have been appearing before you (CBI) from July 17. You must have done some investigation. Everyday appearance is not required,\"" Justice Bhatkar said. Public Prosecutor Sandeep Shinde, appearing for CBI, argued that the offence was of a serious nature and custodial interrogation was required. The court has posted their anticipatory bail petitions for final hearing on August 10. Soon after the sessions court rejected her bail pleas, Teesta told the court that she was shocked and aggrieved. \""I am shocked and aggrieved by the verdict as this is a petty offence. My sympathisers feel that this is an attempt (by the government) to intimidate and possibly eliminate us by the powers (sic),\"" she said. The CBI had on July 8 registered a case against Teesta and Anand alleging that her firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) received around 2.9 lakh USD in foreign donations in violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).Β  According to the agency, SCPPL was not registered under FCRA for collecting money from abroad and the amount of nearly Rs 1.8 crore (2.9 lakh USD) was, therefore, received in violation of the Act as the organisation needed to seek prior approval from the Union Home Ministry. Teesta and her husband, through their lawyer, had told the special CBI court that they were innocent and were falsely implicated. Her advocate Mihir Desai told the court that the only reason why the agency wanted to arrest them was to humiliate them for their work in Gujarat. However, CBI in their reply, last Friday, had said that the motive behind the transfer of foreign contribution to SCPPL reflected interference towards the internal security and activities of India. \""Such act of foreign donor would prejudicially affect the security, strategic, scientific and economic interest of the state and also affect the harmony between religious, social, linguistic or regional groups, castes or communities\"", the CBI had said in its reply while opposing her plea. The agency said the allegations against them (Setalvad and Anand) are serious in nature and it is proposed to unravel all the contours of the offence and the conspiracy during the investigation. Setalvad alleged that the FIR registered against her and her husband was for the purpose of harassing and torturing them, a charge rejected by CBI. \""The applicants are deliberately mixing up the offences alleged against them with non-related issues in order to divert the attention from the serious charges against them,\"" the agency had said. The CBI had also told the court that when their premises were searched on July 14 this year there was total resistance and non-cooperation from their side. \""During the search, an agreement dated September 22,Β 2006 between Ford Foundation and SCPPL were seized which clearly showed that the remittances were granted. There is no mention of any 'consultancy' therein,\"" the reply had said."""
L C Goyal was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO). β€The Prime Minister has approved the appointment of L C Goyal (1979 batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer) as Chairman and Managing Director, India Trade Promotion Organisation,β€ an official statement said. Miffed over the abrupt transfer, Goyal has sought an early retirement, 17 months ahead of schedule, for personal reasons which was approved by the government. The easing out of Goyal is being attributed to the β€toughβ€™ stand he had taken vis-a-vis corporate houses specially the Maran family owned Sun TV. β€His rigidity was creating anti-investment sentiments,β€ a source from government said. Nevertheless, the unceremonious exit of another senior officer, the other being the case of Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, has created turmoil in the bureaucracy. She was replaced by S Jaishankar, who was then Indiaβ€™s ambassador to the US. Goyalβ€™s predecessor Anil Goswami was also asked to quit midway during his tenure when his name figured in a controversy over trying to go easy on Β Congress politician-businessman Matang Singh in an ongoing CBI probe. Mehrishi, a 1978 batch IAS officer of Rajasthan-cadre, was Secretary in the Department of Economic Affairs, Finance Ministry. He was due to retire on Monday but his new assignment comes with a two two-year tenure. He served as a Chief Secretary in Rajasthan and is reportedly in the good books of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Sources said, Goyal was not kept in the loop while the government worked out the Naga accord. It was also speculated that the news on Chief Ministers not being taken into confidence on the accord - was leaked from his office, which angered union home minister Rajnath Singh and Modi himself. The PMO was cut up over Β media reports which claimed that the home ministry was not even provided with a copy of the peace accord. Though Naga talks interlocutor R N Ravi did brief Home Minister Rajnath Singh and home secretary LC Goyal on the Naga accord explaining that it was only a β€frameworkβ€ to proceed with further negotiations on the terms of a final β€accordβ€™ this did little to dispel confusion within the home ministry brass on the β€agreed way forwardβ€. Β Goyal was also upset with the fact that, the MHA proposal to ban NSCN (K) - a Naga Militant group that killed 18 soldiers this year in an ambush in Chandel District of Manipur - hadnβ€™t been accepted. Goyal refused security clearance to Sun TV, the massive south Indian broadcasting conglomerate owned by the controversial Maran brothers, accused of money laundering and corruption. Without a security permit, Sun TV cannot operate. Though some within and outside the government criticized the Home Ministryβ€™s decision, Goyal did not review it. Also, the government was unhappy with his action, or lack of it, against activist Teesta Setalvad for funding violations and his β€no controlβ€ over the joint secretaries. β€With his removal, the government has sent out a clear message to all bureaucrats that they should not cross the line, which put the government in an uncomfortable situation,β€ said a source. A government statement claimed that Goyalβ€™s request for voluntary retirement β€“ citing personal reasons - has been approved by the Prime Minister.
The men who run the government today were at the receiving end during the Emergency 40 years ago. What did they learn? In 1975, a Tamilian disguised as a sardar landed up at Ahmedabad Railway Station to escape from the central government. He was met and escorted to a safe house by a 25-year-old who once sold tea on that stationβ€™s platform. Freeze that moment in history β€” Narendra Modi escorting Subramanian Swamy to his safe house β€” and contrast it to today. What a long way we have come. Or have we? I got the above trivia from Coomi Kapoorβ€™s excellent book, The Emergency: A Personal History. Kapoor was a journalist living in Delhi in those days, and though her book was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the Emergency, it is a timely reminder to the damage people drunk on power can do, and the threat such untrammelled power can pose to a nation. The Emergency began with the filling up of jails. β€The number of those in Indira Gandhiβ€™s prisons during the Emergency,β€ writes Kapoor, β€far exceeded the total number jailed during the 1942 Quit India Movement.β€ This included not just those in the opposition parties but also potential opponents within her own party plus whoever they damn well felt like. (β€The entire Sanskrit department of Delhi University was sent to prison.β€) Personal vendettas were quickly settled, and torture was common in jails. The exploits of Sanjay Gandhi and his coterie were particularly shameful, such as the millions of forced sterilisations he caused. The press was silenced. Loren Jenkins of Newsweek wrote, β€In ten years of covering the world from Francoβ€™s Spain to Maoβ€™s China, I have never encountered such stringent and all encompassing censorship.β€ One of the leaders of the opposition, LK Advani, later said that the press β€was asked to bend and it chose to crawl.β€ A permanent dictatorship seemed likely, and we owe much gratitude to the fact that power made Indira delusional, for she called for elections only because she thought she would win. (Indeed, Sanjay was opposed to the decision.) It is true that a political leader does not need to suspend democracy to devastate a country. Even without the Emergency, Indira would count as one of the worst rulers in our history. Through a series of disastrous economic policies, many of which her deluded partymen still support, she kept tens of millions of people in poverty, and adversely affected all our lives. There are no counterfactuals, of course, and abstract economic arguments do not have the visceral impact of the kind of stories that Kapoorβ€™s excellent book is filled with. Letβ€™s get back to the present. To many, the general elections of last year felt like a landmark event because Modiβ€™s win seemed to mark a final, clean break from everything that post-Independence Congress represented. He stood for many things to many people, though, and it is worth asking how he is doing after a year in government. If youβ€™re an economic liberal like me, Modi has been a disappointment. It is with good reason that people are beginning to refer to this government as UPA 3. Modi has not instituted any far-reaching reforms, and the rhetoric of β€incremental reformsβ€™ does not cut it for me. But itβ€™s fair enough to wait out the five years they have been given before passing judgement. It is in the domain of personal freedoms that Modi has let the country down. Much of this is due to petty vindictiveness, straight out of the Indira Gandhi playbook. Consider how Teesta Setalvad has been harassed after Modi came to power, the latest salvo being the cancellation of the licence of her NGO. (Why should any organisation need a licence from the government anyway? Wasnβ€™t Modi, the messiah, supposed to do away with this kind of nonsense?) Consider the governmentβ€™s harassment of NGOs like Greenpeace, and the offloading of Greenpeace campaigner Priya Pillai when she was on her way to England because officials felt she would give India a β€negative imageβ€ there. Go online, search for videos of the recent Patel uprising in Ahmedabad, and see the shocking brutality with which the police crack down on common people. (The Gujarat government also banned the mobile internet during this time, as well as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.) Consider all the nonsense the fringe elements on the Hindu right are getting up to, and the silence of the government on these issues β€” the same silence you would get from Indira every time she was confronted with the antics of her psychopathic son Sanjay. Modi has not declared an Emergency or jailed opponents, but this approach to power does remind me of 1975, and makes me wonder. Many of the prominent political actors of today played small roles in that particular production. Arun Jaitley spent the years of the Emergency in jail. In the hundreds of hours of solitary contemplation that he no doubt had, what did he think about? When the young party worker Narendra Modi guided Subramanian Swamy to his safe house, what did they talk about? Was it about how power corrupts, the necessity to impose limits on it and the tragedy of how politicians in India sought to rule than to serve? Or did they simply say to each other, β€Just wait. Just wait till we are on the other side, and we are the ones in charge.β€ I suspect it was the latter. And what a loss that is. Amit Varma is a novelist.

The government will also help NGOs in hosting their own websitesWary of being dubbed β€anti-civil societyβ€, the Narendra Modi government has decided to drop a contentious clause in the Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR), 2015, which would have made it mandatory for NGOs receiving foreign contributions to declare their social media accounts like their Twitter handle and Facebook pages with the government. It will be made optional instead. The government has also dropped the clause which required NGOs to post their returns and activities on a weekly basis. It will now be done quarterly. The government will also help NGOs in hosting their own websites since it proposes to make all official communication and dealings online now. The move comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modiβ€™s visit to the United States later this week as the government wants to shed its image of being one that is clamping down on foreign donors like the Ford Foundation, which has been put along with 16 others in the prior-permission category. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) cancelled the registration of Greenpeace India and also that of the Gujarat-based social activist Teesta Setalvadβ€™s Sabrang Trust, which received funds from the Ford Foundation. The MHA is all set to notify the amended Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR), which will govern foreign contributions received by NGOs. Through its draft amendment rules, which were made public in June this year, the Home Ministry had proposed making all dealings with NGOs online. After the draft rules were put up for comments, many NGOs wrote to the MHA that the ones working in the interiors of the country did not have access to the Internet or the wherewithal to create a website of their own. The government has now decided to host a website for such NGOs. β€We will assist the NGOs in hosting a website of their own, since all dealings will be online from now on, a website will be a prerequisite now,β€ said a senior government official. The MHA has, however, decided to stick to the clause where banks have to inform it about all foreign funds coming to an NGO account within 48 hours. β€Through this arrangement, we will be able to monitor if the foreign funds are being misused or not. Say, if we have received an adverse report from a State or any other intelligence agency about an NGO being involved in anti-national activities, then we can immediately stop the payment,β€ a senior Home Ministry official said. The NGOs, on their part, have opposed the move and said this was a ploy to pry on their activities. The MHA has also reduced the number of forms to be filled in by the NGOs and now the registration, renewal and prior permission forms have been combined into one single form, called FC-3. β€Several NGOs gave us representations that it was not possible to post about their activities and expenditure statement on a weekly basis. We understood this and have decided to replace it with that on a quarterly basis,β€ said the official.
TELLING IT STRAIGHT Reams have been written against NGOs in India. For many, they are symbols of treason and sedition. For others, they are agent saboteurs but have we paused to think why is it in this country that we always throw the baby out with the bathwater? There are many NGOs doing sterling work: the kind that Governments are incapable of. Many of them do it selflessly and without seeking recognition. I am involved with the likes of the Ila Trust which will complete 25 years run by a simple woman, Reeta Dev Varma: she tends to the infirm and the ones seeking medical attention: she is out every morning on the streets of Old Delhi helping those who have given up on life. Apart from medical attention, she provides free medicines and now even water thanks to Coca Cola, biscuits thanks to Glaxo Smith Kline and rice thanks to Amira. Hewlett Packard International has been a long-standing supporter. She uses her house as an office and is selfless to a fault. Then there is the Aasra Trust in Dehradun which again does yeoman service for children. From education to looking after them to enabling them a life of dignity that the State is unable or unwilling to provide. Then there is SEWA run by the inimitable Ela Bhatt, who in any other nation would have been conferred the highest civilian honour for the brilliant work she does for women empowerment. And then there are those NGOs whose purpose is to seek accountability from the State: something that is the right of every citizen but then again as individuals, a right difficult to exercise. I don't wish to go in to the controversy surrounding Teesta Setalvad since the matter is subjudice but to ban Greenpeace from collecting money from foreign donors or making Ford Foundations' life miserable is appalling to say the least. When Governments behave in this boorish manner, the signal they send out is they have something to hide. Greenpeace is recognised for its outlandish ways to bring attention to crippling global issues be it illegal mining or treacherous whaling and Governments must believe they are doing it with the right intent. The short-term embarrassment is no excuse for reprisals that are inflicted on such organisations. I have, for a long time, been an ardent admirer of Amnesty International and am delighted that Amnesty is now in India as an Indian entity without any money coming in from foreign shores hence leaving the Government with little leeway to either threaten them or bamboozle them into submission. Amnesty in India is fighting for causes that every Indian should be fighting for but is either ignorant or scared or both. Take for instance the atrocities on innocent people in Jammu and Kashmir or the plight of those victims of sexual harassment who find it difficult to get solace at a police station or for that matter the fundamental rights of citizens and the trampling of those by some people in power. These are important national issues and we need NGOs like Amnesty to highlight these no matter the short-term pain. And it is time for people in civil society to laud the role that these NGOs play rather than keep suspecting them of being anti-national. The real antinationals are the ones who lie in denial and don't wish to see real change for real people. That is more worrying than anything else. I was delighted to learn that Amnesty in partnership with local State Police bodies has begun tis campaign Ready to Report which will enable women who want to report sexual violence to go to the police and do it safely and with dignity: these are important social issues and if an NGO is doing this, we need to applaud rather than worry. We are at an interesting stage in our country's life. We can either bring about real change for real people or remain in eternal denial. The choice is ours and time is seriously running out. ?

By Abhay Kumar for TwoCircles.net, Communal violence, exclusion and assaults on religious freedom were listed as major issues before Indian Muslims during the Golden Jubilee function of the All India Muslim Majlis-e- Mushawarat (AIMMM). Held on a bright Monday, August 31, in New Delhiβ€™s India Islamic Cultural Centre, the function was attended by hundreds of Muslim intellectuals, heads of community organisations, religious and political leaders, diplomats, journalists, students and civil society members. Mushawart golden jubilee celebration on August 31, 2015 at IIC, New Delhi (Courtesy: AIMMM) Inaugurating the function, Vice-President, Hamid Ansari, too, shared the broader concerns of the AIMMM. During his speech, he raised the issue of β€identity and securityβ€, β€education and empowermentβ€, calling for an β€equitable shareβ€ in the largesse of the stateβ€ and a β€fair shareβ€ for Muslims in decision-makingβ€. He, therefore, asked the government to launch affirmative action for Muslims. β€The default by the State or its agents in terms of deprivation, exclusion and discrimination (including failure to provide security) is to be corrected by the State; this needs to be done at the earliest and appropriate instruments developed for it.β€™ While Vice President Ansariβ€™s concerns were shared by secular and progressive sections, they came in for virulent attacks from the Hindu Right, which has been targeting him for quite some time. While the VHP demanded that he should either apologize for making β€communalβ€ and β€politicalβ€ statement or resign. Earlier, he had also fallen foul of BJP-RSS leaders for his β€absenceβ€ during the official function of the International Yoga Day on May 21 and for row over the fact that he did not salute during national anthem. Ansariβ€™s speech was followed by three more sessions in which the history, achievement of AIMMM, issues of Muslim community and country related to economics, politics, education, media, riots, Urdu, terrorism. The last session saw conferring on Life-Time achievement awards to 23 personalities including five non-Muslims such as Justice (Retired.) Rajinder Sachar, Teesta Setalvad, John Dayal, Harsh Mander-all Human Rights activists. The term Mushawarat, having an Arabic origin, means consultation. Wa shawirhum or β€consult them [in the matter]β€™-- the logo of the AIMMM, derived from the Quran (159:3) -- is self-explanatory about its purpose and functioning. The AIMMM, thus, works towards providing a β€common platformβ€ for different Muslim organisations to collectively think, speak, deliberate and arrive at a β€common minimum programmeβ€. Mushawart golden jubilee celebration on August 31, 2015 at IIC, New Delhi (Courtesy: AIMMM) On this occasion, the AIMMM also published a charter of demands. In order to check the declining representation of Muslims from both legislative bodies and public institutions, it reiterated its demand for adopting β€the proportionate representation systemβ€ instead of the present practice of the first-past the post system. It is to be noted that the campaign for proportional representation has been renewed in the recent past as the proportion of Muslims has declined. In a study conducted in 2013, Zeeshan Shaikh empirically showed that there was no Muslim minister in the thirteen-BJP ruled states. Even in the Congress-ruled states, the situation was not much better. For example, Himachal Pradesh had no Muslim minister, while Haryana had only one minister. In the wake of this political marginalisation, Maharashtra government-constituted Dr Mahmood-ur-Rahman committee recommended that Muslims should have a political reservation: β€A lot of times political parties have got away by giving token representation to Muslims. The absence of Muslims in positions to influence policies is one of the reasons for their present situation. If it wants to uplift the community, the government should give proportional representation to Muslims in cabinet.β€™ The AIMMM, which calls itself a β€non-political bodyβ€, β€does not participate in elections but it has been guiding the Muslim community at the time of parliamentary or assembly elections with the objective of strengthening the secular forces and facilitating due Muslim representation in assemblies and parliament.β€™ Besides, it has also called upon Muslims to support β€the most winnable secular candidates, irrespective of religion and caste.β€™ No wonder then that the JD (U) Rajya Sabha Member KC Tyagi was conspicuously present at the meet. Having placed in a tough fight against the BJP-led NDA alliance in the upcoming Bihar Assembly Elections, JD (U), RJD and Congressβ€™ β€grand allianceβ€™ is eyeing consolidated Muslim votes through the support of the AIMMM. On the issue of communal violence, the AIMM has asked for β€allotting one day in year in Parliament to discuss communal situation in the country; and to hold one yearly meeting at least of the National Integration Councilβ€™. Further, the AIMMM β€demands implementation of the recommendations of Justice Liberahan and Justice Srikrishna Commissionβ€™, urging the government to β€ensure the security and honour of all communities.β€™ In the recent past, particularly after the coming of Narendra Modi Government, there has been a spurt in the incidents of β€low-intensityβ€™ communal riots and attacks on the religious places of minorities. Even in the national capital Delhi was the centre of Hindutva attacks when the areas of Trilokpuri saw the Hindutva forces, backed up by police, targeting Muslims and the churches were vandalised on many occasions. Moreover, the issues of attacks on religious and cultural rights also figured prominently in the AIMMMβ€™s meet. In the name of β€ghar wapsiβ€™, Muslims were forced to convert to Hinduism while those who had converted to Islam were threatened to re-convert to Hinduism. Besides, the whole communal polarisation around β€Surva Namaskarβ€™, and β€Yogaβ€™ has further instilled fear among the hearts of minorities. Mushawart golden jubilee celebration on August 31, 2015 at IIC, New Delhi (Courtesy: AIMMM) Thus, the AIMMMβ€™s charter β€reiterates that in a multi-religious society, like our motherland, religious freedom promised in the Constitution must be fully respected and guaranteed against forcible, direct or indirect, conversion, or change in the personal laws relating to birth, marriage, death and succession, or any intervention in religious instructions or any assault on places of worship and other places of religious significance.β€™ In the wake of social and economic backwardness as documented by Sachar and Mishra Commission reports, the AIMMM asks for β€universal reservations of all communitiesβ€. Besides, the AIMMM supports conferring of SC status on Dalit Muslims by doing away with the Presidential Order of 1950, which deprives Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christian of the benefits of reservation. It is to be borne in mind that the historical context of the formation of the AIMMM is the rise of incidents of communal violence in the early 1960s in areas like Rourkela, Jamshedpur and Jabalpur. This created an atmosphere of fear, prompting Muslims to leave the country in large number. Apart from the anti-Muslim riots, other factors that contributed to the decline of Muslims by the 1960s were the abolition of Zamindari system, withdrawal of reservation and other governmentβ€™s protective measures to Muslims, discrimination of Urdu coupled with imposition of sanskritized Hindi, and failure of government to promote Muslim entrepreneurs. Against this background, the AIMMM was established in the Sulemania Hall of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow on August 8-9, 1964 under the chairmanship of then M.P. Syed Mahmood. With a hundred-participant from top Muslim organisations such as the Jamaat e Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulema Hind, Muslim League, Khilafat Committee, Tamirati Millat Hyderabad and Imarat Shariah Bihar, Jharkhand & Orissa. The main purpose of the AIMMM is brilliantly encapsulated by renowned Arabic and Islamic scholar Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi in his welcome speech: β€What we need most is to avoid division (inteshar), organisational ego (jamayati ananiyat), sectarian prejudice (girohi asbiyat) and feeling of supremacy (jazbay-e-tafawwuq).β€™ However, the dream of the founders of the AIMMM has not so far been fulfilled as there are many key Muslim organisations, such as the Jamiat Ulema Hind, which are not the members of the AIMMM, a fact which was also accepted by its president Zafarul Islam Khan, β€It is true that some organisations are not part of it, especially the Jamiat Ulama-e Hind. Everyone is free to join or to leave the organisationβ€™. While the Jamaat-e-Ulama-e-Hind was largely absent in the Golden Jubilee celebration of the AIMMM, the leaders from other key Muslim organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Ahle Hadith were noticeably present. For examples, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind president Maulana Syed Jalaluddin Umri presided over the second session of the meet while another former senior leader of Jamaat-e-Islami and President of Welfare Party of India, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas was the speaker on the theme of β€politics of terrorismβ€™. Apart from the failure of the AIMMM to bring all major Muslim organisations under its umbrella, it was also plagued by internal conflicts, leading to the division of the AIMMM into two fractions in 2000, one headed by Syed Shahabuddin and another by Maulana Salim Qasmi. However, the current president of the AIMMM Zafarul Islam Khan was able to get these fractions merged within the organisation two years back. With the merge of the AIMMM and a successful meet of the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the AIMMM, its supporters hope that it would be able to bring to the public the issues of minority and will work as the advocacy group to get them addressed. To achieve this goal, the AIMMM needs greater coordination among Muslim organisations and other secular and democratic groups. β€¦β€¦..

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court today issued notice to the state government on social activist Teesta Setalvad's plea seeking exemption from personal appearance before a police station here where a case has been lodged against her for allegedly hurting the religious sentiments. Justice A J Desai directed the state to file a reply and adjourned the hearing to October 16. The court also allowed her, as an interim relief, to appear at the police station on any day in the first week instead of the fifth day of month. Setalvad wants exemption from appearing in person before Ghatlodia police station here. Last month, the High Court had asked her to approach the City Civil and Sessions Court. But the lower court rejected her plea, so she again moved the High Court. A case was lodged against Setalvad -- who has doggedly pursued the cases of 2002 riot victims against the state government and political leaders -- in August last year by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist for uploading `objectionable' pictures of Hindu deities on Twitter. She removed the images later. She has been charged with Indian Penal Code sections 153(a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups) and section 205(a) (outraging religious feelings). While granting her anticipatory bail in June, the sessions court had said that she shall appear before Ghatlodia police station on the fifth of every month.

 Updated: June 6, 2015 2:17 am Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL), a private company owned by Setalvad, had received funds to the tune of $90,000 in 2004-05 and $2,00,000 in 2006-09 from the Ford Foundation, said a report. In more trouble for social activist Teesta Setalvad, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sent another showcause notice to a publishing company owned by her. A team of MHA officials will inspect the field office of Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL), a private company owned by Setalvad, this week amid allegations that it misused the money received from Ford Foundation for other purposes. Earlier in April this year, on a request made by Gujarat government, MHA had inspected the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) accounts of two NGOs owned by Setalvad β€“ The Sabrang Trust and the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP).  When contacted, a senior functionary of Sabrang Trust confirmed that they had received an intimation from the MHA that a team was going to inspect their book of accounts. The official refused to be identified. The Sabrang Trust and Sabrang Communication and Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL), a private company owned by Setalvad, had received funds to the tune of $90,000 in 2004-05 and $2,00,000 in 2006-09 from the Ford Foundation, said a report sent by Gujarat government to MHA, quoting figures from official replies furnished by the Foundation to the Ahmedabad Crime Branch. MHA officials will be scrutinizing the records of SCPPL, primarily on four grounds: 1. The FCRA Act prohibits funding of foreign journalists and editors from the organisationβ€™s account. There are allegations against SCPPL that it diverted foreign donations received from Ford Foundation. 2. For allegedly not utilising the funds it was meant for. 3.Β  For allegedly providing secretarial services to the other two NGOs β€” Sabrang Trust and CJP β€” from the same administrative funds corpus. For not paying service tax for doing so. 4.Β  SCPPL, Sabrang Trust and CJP were running from the same office. β€Based on our earlier inspection report, we had prepared a preliminary report and the second visit pertains to more queries that have cropped up. Itβ€™s a kind of showcause notice, which we give to an NGO before cancelling its registration,β€ said a senior official. The Gujarat government had in March complained to the MHA that the Foundation funded β€anti-Indiaβ€ activities of Setalvadβ€™s NGOs β€” Sabrang Trust and the Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP) β€” and requested that the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) registration of the two NGOs be cancelled. In April, the MHA had put the Foundation under the β€prior approval categoryβ€, which meant that all funds from the organisation to recipients in India would have to be cleared by the government. The international NGO was also put on the Home Ministryβ€™s watch list in the interest of β€national securityβ€.  
 Updated: June 18, 2015 10:34 am Supreme Court A senior advocate arguing in favour of the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Wednesday told the Supreme Court that its judges should walk in the court corridors wearing a burqa to get a sense of increasing frustration among lawyers over bad appointments and the deteriorating justice delivery system. β€My Lords should wear a burqa and roam in the court corridors to hear the way lawyers talk about the judges of this court. You will get first-hand account of the rotting justice delivery system. The kind of lawyers who are being appointed as judges is a disgrace,β€ senior advocate Dushyant Dave, arguing for the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), told a Constitution Bench led by Justice J S Khehar. Dave, who is also president of the SCBA, said the top court has used the Collegiumβ€™s power to appoint judges as a β€giantβ€, and has turned its duty to protect human rights into a β€shamβ€.  β€Be it the 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 2002 Gujarat riots, none of these cases have rendered justice, and if you were to see how wrong appointments have been made, you would know the reason. It is a shame how every court is going an extra mile to protect politicians and film stars, and ordinary citizens are deprived of justice,β€ said Dave. β€Acting chief justice of a high court decides to sit in a single bench, gets the roster for criminal cases, has the case transferred to his bench from another bench and quashes the FIR only because the person involved happens to be a top film star. Which driver gets bail within hours of conviction unless he happens to be a top film star? Which person will get bail by this court on the first day of the bail plea and without a notice to the other side if it is not a big politician? It is a shame,β€ he added. Dave also claimed that while every accused in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case and the Gujarat riots case, including life term convict Maya Kodnani, had got bail from the apex court, Teesta Setalvad, who fought for the riot victims, had to run from pillar to post for protection from arrest. The bench, also comprising Justices J Chelameswar, Madan B Lokur, Kurian Joseph and Adarsh K Goel, retorted that it was not the system, but some individuals who may have been in the wrong. It also said that some of the judges being criticised had been lawyers earlier. Dave replied, β€The institution does not have a system to correct it. I am very sorry to say it but you donβ€™t listen to anyone, my lordβ€¦ You have used your powers as a giant. Even the Parliament cannot correct it. The majority of the appointments are impeccable but it is the minority that is giving this institution a bad name and you donβ€™t entertain even the smallest of suggestions.β€ β€Once they are appointed as judges, there is no scrutiny and some of them have brought down the reputation of constitutional posts. Oath as a judge has become a joke and I doubt many of them even remember it anymore,β€ he added. Asking the judges to introspect, Dave said it had been β€very difficult to digestβ€ the way the Collegium had been functioning, and said the NJAC would be a perfectly constitutional mechanism to appoint judges in the higher judiciary. The Bench said, β€You talk about a few judges but you donβ€™t talk about hundreds of others who work tirelessly day in and day out for this system. You crush them under the weight of others.β€ Although he stood with it to defend the NJAC, Dave also hit out at the government, saying that it wanted to appoint β€pliable and weak judgesβ€ since they could be easily manipulated. Asking Dave to suggest ways to remedy the situation, the Bench said it was in favour of improving the existing system. β€If we quash the NJAC, the new system may be somewhere in between the old system (Collegium) and the NJAC. Give us suggestions on how to do it,β€ it said. The arguments in the case will continue on Thursday.  
 Updated: June 19, 2015 6:20 pm Social activist Teesta Setalvad. (Source: PTI) Two NGOs run by social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband have been served notice by Home Ministry for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and asked to reply within 15 days. Sabarang Trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), run by Teesta and her husband Javed Anand, were served the notice two days ago following an on-site inspection of records and books of accounts carried out by Home Ministry officials in April this year.  Sources said during the probe it was found that they were running a magazine Communalism Combat as co-editors as well as printer and publisher of their company Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Ltd (SCPPL) and allegedly received foreign contribution. Under the FCRA, no foreign contribution shall be accepted by any correspondent, columnist, cartoonist, editor, owner, printer or publisher of a registered newspaper. CJP, which has been fighting cases for victims of 2002 Gujarat riots, had received a total foreign contribution of around Rs 1.18 crore from 2008-09 to 2013-14. According to notice, more than 80 per cent or nearly Rs 95 lakh was spent for legal aid. While the entity was registered for β€Educational and Economicβ€™ purposes, it received foreign contribution for activities such as β€Legal Aidβ€™ which is covered under purpose β€Socialβ€™. Hence, it violated the provisions of the FCRA rules, they contended. β€On review of vouchers of the association it was found that Sabrang Trust have made payment of Rs 12 lakh from FCRA designated account to Citi Bank and Union Bank of India on account of credit facilities taken through credit cards belonging to Setalvad and Anand. β€This amounts to use of foreign contribution for the purposes not authorised as per the provisions of FCRA 2010. Thus association has violated Section 8(1) (a) of FCRA 2010,β€ the Home Ministry notice said. The Home Ministry investigation also found that Anand has taken international medical policy for visiting Lahore and debited the amount in the account of Sabrang Trust. Further, even book purchases and travel expenses incurred by him to attend meetings with Peopleβ€™s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) were debited in Sabrang Trust allegedly in violation of Section 8(1)(a) of FCRA. The Home Ministryβ€™s inspection has also found that an amount of Rs 50 lakh was allegedly transferred by Sabrang Trust to SCPPL which is not registered under FCRA. FCRA rules prohibit transfer of foreign contribution to non-FCRA account unless such entity is also registered and had been granted the certificate or obtained prior permission under this Act. The investigation also found various alleged irregularities like administrative expenditure exceeding more than 50 per cent. Besides, different figures towards expenses incurred on legal aid in the books of accounts and in the receipts of payment accounts, closing balance of the proceeding year was allegedly not reported as opening balance and even the funds received from United Nations not found in the bank statement, the sources claimed.  
 Updated: June 27, 2015 8:01 am Social activist Teesta Setalvad The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Friday ordered a CBI probe into the functioning of one of the publishing firms owned by social activist Teesta Setalvad and also seized one of the bank accounts associated with it. An official said Sabrang Communication Publishing Private Limited (SCPPL), being a private-owned firm, was allegedly involved in violation of the rules of Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) in accepting a donation of $2.9 lakh from Ford Foundation without getting clearance of the MHA. β€Sabrang lobbied with the government in the public sphere to deepen and broaden the concept of minorities. It is stated that lobbying with a political party is not allowed under FCRA Act, 2010,β€ said a government official.  According to the rules, an organisation or a private firm can accept donations from overseas only after it is registered under FCRA. This donation was, therefore, a β€serious violationβ€ of FCRA provisions which mandate funding from a foreign source to only those recipients who have FCRA registration, the sources said. A bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, has been frozen at the instruction of the Home Ministry, the official said. As reported by The Indian Express, Setalvadβ€™s SCPPL was served a notice on June 4 and the organisation was asked to furnish a reply by June 19. A team of MHA officials inspected SCPPLβ€™s office but were not satisfied with the replies given by them. The Gujarat government had asked the MHA to take action against Ford Foundation, alleging that the US-based organisation was β€interfering in internal affairsβ€ of the country and also β€abetting communal disharmonyβ€ through an NGO run by Setalvad. The fund transfer from Ford Foundation, at present, has to be cleared by a nodal official in the MHA. In April, the Centre had ordered that funds from the Ford Foundation should not be released by any bank to any Indian NGO without mandatory permission from the MHA. The Gujarat government and Teesta have been embroiled in legal battles. While she has filed several cases against the government functionaries, including the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi in connection with post-Godhra riots of 2002, the police have filed a case of alleged embezzlement of funds against her.

 Updated: June 27, 2015 6:19 pm Social activist Teesta Setalvad Social activist Teesta Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand have approached the Gujarat High Court for de-freezing the bank accounts of their two NGOs-Β Sabrang trust and Citizens for Justice and Peace. The bank accounts of Setalvad, Anand and the two NGOs were frozen by the city crime branch last year, soon after it began investigating an alleged embezzlement case wherein she was said to have collected Rs 1.51 crore from national and international donors promising to convert Gulbarg society toΒ 2002 riots museum but later used the money for personal use. Setalvad along with others had filed the plea before the High Court on June 24 and it is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Sonia Gokani on July 10.  They had challenged the order of a city metropolitan court, which had last November rejected their pleas to de-freeze the bank accounts and observed it may affect the investigation of the case. The lower court in its order had also observed that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation of the case. One of the residents of Gulbarg Society, Firoz Khan Pathan had filed a complaint against Setalwad and others alleging that money was raised to make a museum at Gulbarg Society in memory of those who were killed during the 2002 Gujarat riots but it had not been utilised for the purpose. On January 5 last year, an FIR was lodged under IPC Section 120 (B) for criminal conspiracy, Section 406 (fraud) and Section 420 (cheating) against Setalwad, Anand, Tanvir Jafri, son of slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, chairman of Gulberg society Salim Sandhi and secretary of the society Feroz Gulzar for allegedly usurping Rs 1.51 crore. On Friday, the Centre had asked CBI to probe the receipt of over Rs 3 crore by her private firm Sabrang Communication and Publishing Pvt Limited (SCPPL) linked to her from foreign donors, including US-based Ford Foundation, in alleged violation of FCRA rules. Government had also frozen the bank account of the firm located in Juhu, Mumbai, as the Home Ministry claimed that the firm was not authorised to receive funds from abroad as it was not registered under Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA). On 28 February, 2002, after the Godhra train carnage, 69 people including Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society here during the riots.

The Prime Minister's Office declined to comment on the challenge, because the case is underway. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also declined comment. Setalvad said she pored over testimonies of victims, policemen, bureaucrats, politicians and members of hardline Hindu organisations to piece together Modi's role in the riots. She examined Modi's phone records and police intelligence reports as well as evidence from policeman Sanjiv Bhatt. Bhatt was a state intelligence officer during the riots and has previously given testimony claiming Modi told officials to allow Hindus to vent their anger for the deaths of 59 Hindu pilgrims in a fire on a train in the Gujarat town of Godhra, after clashes between Muslims and Hindus at the station. Last month the central government expelled Bhatt from the police force. He is challenging the move in court. Interior Ministry officials in New Delhi said the decision to probe Setalvad's bank transactions and sack Bhatt were not related to the case against Modi. \""It is a coincidence that our orders came at the exact same time when the court case started in Gujarat.

  Ahmedabad: Zakia Jafri, a frail 76-year-old, has begun what may be the last legal battle to pin blame on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for deadly riots that shook Gujarat when he was chief minister, and claimed her husbandβ€™s life. Narendra Modi denies any involvement in the 2002 unrest, one of the worst outbreaks of religious violence in independent India. In 2013, a panel appointed by the Supreme Court said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. It was the third investigation to come to the same conclusion. Since then, the prime minister has shed his international image as a hardline Hindu nationalist, adopted the mantle of progressive economic reformer, won a landslide election in 2014 and earned a place at the high table of global leaders.

At around the time the Gujarat High Court agreed to hear the case last month, police investigating alleged fraud raided the home and offices of Teesta Setalvad, who has represented dozens of victims of the riots and won several convictions.
